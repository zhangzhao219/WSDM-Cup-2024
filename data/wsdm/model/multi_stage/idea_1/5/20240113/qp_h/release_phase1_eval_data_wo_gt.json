Secondly, the best way to make a child obey is to first listen to the child. Listening to them is demonstrating the power of listening and teaching them how to listen. Listening to children will help them release intense emotions. Most importantly, the important basis for cooperation is to be listened to. Therefore, you need to listen to what they say, observe their actions, and even play games with them is also a way of listening. During the listening process, you need to make sure you are no longer emotional, sit next to the child, respond gently to the child, and do not use the tone of 'I am an adult, I will tell you how to think and what to do'. Finally, truly efficient parenting is to let the child 'agree' on the basis of acceptance and abide by the rules.\n"

The interface between the wire and the heating wire must absolutely not touch the water. Secondly, you must watch when you are burning, because it actually boils water very quickly, it takes about ten minutes for me to fill a bucket. The most important point is that you must not touch the water directly when boiling water, you absolutely can't. To feel the temperature, you can dry your hands and lightly touch some parts of the outer perimeter of the container (as far away from 'Rèdékuài' as possible). Another point, absolutely do not dry burn, easy to explode and short circuit. After putting the 'Rèdékuài' in the water, the water should almost cover the heating wire to the plastic, but it can't touch the electric wire, and then plug it in.\n"

This can help us intuitively see the difference between each color, making it convenient for us to accurately select the color we need when coloring. When choosing colored pencils, the first thing to look at is the color rendering degree, the second is overlay color, and the third is smoothness and delicacy. For beginners, oil-based colored pencils are a good choice for practice. In terms of color matching, the important thing is the distinction between grass and cloud lines, and there will be no subsequent problems once the overall tone color is determined, and then just some creative color paving and point-view trees. For example, you can use red to match green, take out all red series, and all green series, and arrange them according to the numbers on the pencils, so the comparison is clearer. If there are no numbers, you can also arrange them randomly, it does not affect the effect.\n"

        "query": "So how can you tell if someone is lying?\nTo determine whether someone is lying, we can observe their body language and eyes. Liars tend to show blushing, nervousness, sweating, not daring to look directly, restlessness, etc. when they lie and are questioned, and even have some small movements, indicating that they are very nervous. Liars will deliberately correct their actions, for example, when they are surprised, they will maintain a surprised expression, rather than return to normal in a second. Liars will deliberately make their description of what happened very smooth, and even embellish it, but often the real things need time to recall, to accurately express. When judging whether a person is lying, observing their body language and eyes is a common technique. For example, frequent hand movements touching the face, lips or nose; clenching fists, grabbing objects or their own body; crossing fingers, rubbing palms and other nervous hand movements; stiff body, shrinking, avoiding eye contact; small body shaking or leg shaking unnatural movements; avoidance of gaze: frequently avoiding direct eye contact or changing the focus; pupil changes: pupils dilate or shrink, although this may be due to changes in light or emotion; blinking frequency: increase or decrease in blinking frequency, especially in situations inconsistent with usual. These observation indicators are called non-verbal clues in criminal investigation methods and can be part of the clues, but these indicators alone cannot determine whether a person is lying. In criminal investigation methods, these observation indicators are usually combined with other evidence and technical means, such as facial expression analysis, voice analysis, behavior analysis, etc., to comprehensively judge whether a person is lying.\n"

        "query": "So how should I accurately measure the size of the bedroom door?\nTo accurately measure the size of the bedroom door, you can follow these steps: First, round along the wall, confirm all hole names and mark the opening direction. Then, measure the hole size and write it on the wall with a marker. Next, copy all measurement data to the form and take photos of all holes on both sides. Finally, add names to all photos. For the measurement of the door hole, you need to actually measure the width and height of the door hole, and see if the upper, middle, and lower parts of the door hole are consistent. If they are not consistent, take the narrowest part as the standard, but the error should not exceed 20mm. Also, measure the thickness of the door hole wall at the upper, middle, and lower parts to see if the thickness of the wall is the same. At the same time, see if the thickness of the left and right walls and the thickness of the top wall of the door hole are the same. If they are not the same, take their maximum value, but the error should not exceed 5mm. If the wall thickness error exceeds 5mm, it needs to be corrected. If the wall is a T-wall, a false wall with a width of 50-60mm needs to be made with plywood to place the door casing. The thickness is the same as the wall thickness. The thickness of the door hole wall should not be less than 80mm. The strength of the door frame with a size lower than 80mm is not very high, and the support for the door is not enough. If it is less than 80mm, the thickness of the wall needs to be increased to more than 80mm. When there is a protruding beam on the door hole, the upper door casing cannot be installed. A false wall with a height of 50-60mm also needs to be made with plywood, which is the same length as the width of the door hole and the same depth as the thickness of the door hole. If there are steps in the door hole, the face casing on the side with steps should add the height of the steps, and the specific size depends on the height of the steps. The thickness of the toilet and kitchen door hole wall must pay special attention to the thickness of the wall tiles on the wall. Generally, single-sided tiles are 25mm thick, and double-sided tiles are 50mm thick. The specific situation is confirmed by the designer, customer, and renovation company. The final size should include the thickness of the wall tiles. It is best to measure after the wall tiles are pasted. Pay attention to the opening direction of the door when measuring. The definition of the opening direction is: looking from the front of the door, the hinge is on the left for the left opening, and the hinge is on the right for the right opening.\n"

Children of this age can be taught to check their vision, can cooperate with their parents to persist in training, and at the same time it does not interfere with learning. However, if it is discovered too late, don't blindly give up training. There are also many successful cases of 12-year-olds who have been able to rid themselves of amblyopia through traditional + software training methods. Therefore, even if it is discovered after the age of 12, there is still hope for recovery with the right training methods. It should be noted that after the age of 12, it is difficult to treat it once the optic nerve is fully developed. Therefore, the timing of amblyopia treatment is very critical. During the visual development stage of children, the brain's plasticity is stronger, and the response to treatment is also better. Before the age of 12 is the golden period for amblyopia treatment, because during this period, the child's visual system is still in development, and the brain's adaptability to visual information is stronger.\n"

These two letters are the biggest difference and the key to pronunciation. Secondly, you need to master the pronunciation method of prenasal and nasal sounds.

When pronouncing prenasal sounds, the air is sent forward, and the mouth shape opens and closes. Nasal sound g is a root tongue sound, our pronunciation position will be relatively backward, and the point of force is the root of the tongue, when pronouncing, the opening of the mouth will be relatively large.

        "query": "So how can cockroaches be eradicated completely?\nTo completely eradicate cockroaches, you need to follow three steps. The first step is to find the cockroach nest. The second step is to change the home environment, which is a very important factor. Most places where German roaches are noisy at home are typically dirty and messy indoor environments, lots of things, and they don't pay attention to hygiene. Food and snacks are everywhere, and they are lazy at first glance. So if you want to eradicate cockroaches, you must throw away the things that should be thrown away at home, especially the things that have not been used for two years. Don't hesitate to throw away and turn your home into a place where cockroaches like to hide. The third step is to use the right tools and methods to kill cockroaches. For example, pyrethroid insecticides can adhere to the sprayed objects to form a drug film on the objects and stay for a while. This pyrethroid effective component film has an avoidance effect on cockroaches. Then, the probability of cockroaches going to eat gel bait on the drug film will be greatly reduced. In addition, fipronil is a third-generation nicotinic insecticide that is very friendly and low-toxic to mammals. Its ld50 toxicity is lower than that of salt. After being dissolved in water, it can be sprayed on sofas, carpets, floor mats, etc., and a touch-kill drug film with a lasting effect for several weeks can be formed after drying.\n"

When soft tissues of the human body are injured, swelling will occur, which is caused by the exudation of soft tissues after injury. At this time, if local cooling is applied to the injured area, it can cause various ducts in the soft tissue to contract, reducing cell metabolism, and thus the exudate will also be reduced. The ice compress can have analgesic, anti-inflammatory, and swelling-reducing effects. It is recommended to apply ice for 5 minutes at a time, apply it again after a 10-minute interval, and apply it 3-5 times a day depending on the pain. As for how many days it should last, since ice has no side effects, it can be used throughout the recovery period, but the frequency of ice application should be adjusted according to the individual's condition. Each ice application time is controlled at 15-20 minutes, if the swelling is more serious, you can apply 3-4 times a day, each interval 2-3 hours, the interval time is not recommended less than 1 hour.\n"

Stretching after physical training not only helps muscles relax and reduces pain after exercise, but also helps prevent sports injuries. If you do not stretch properly after tiring exercise, your muscles will remain tense, which can easily lead to muscle fatigue, stiffness, and even possible sports injuries. In addition, stretching after exercise is different from before, it requires static stretching to relax the tense muscles. You need to relax when your body temperature is hot, don't wait for people to sweat and cool down before stretching. Stretching when the body temperature is hot will stretch more open.

Its composition includes the natural properties of natural objects, such as shape, color, sound, lines, and the harmonious unity of various parts, which are necessary conditions for the formation of natural beauty. Secondly, when natural objects establish a specific aesthetic relationship with people in practice, they have human social content, confirm human essential power, adapt to human living needs, and are beneficial and harmless to people, they are beautiful to people. Finally, the main feature of natural beauty is that it emphasizes the physical form of nature, arouses human aesthetics with the sensory form of nature, and its highest form of expression is the beauty of the human body: that is, the beauty of the human body structure. Natural beauty is a subject of human aesthetics, the source of beauty, and one of the objects of artistic expression.

        "query": "So how can we avoid this situation?\nTo avoid the situation where children cough at home, you can take the following measures: First, try to keep the baby's environment clean and hygienic, ventilate the room regularly, and choose an air purifier suitable for the child's age to purify the air, which can help reduce the number of coughs. Second, the temperature and humidity in the baby's room should be appropriate, avoid the baby getting cold and excessive sweating. Being in a damp environment for a long time at low or high temperatures will increase the cough. Third, ensure a balanced diet every day, eat a moderate amount of vitamin-rich foods, such as tomatoes, carrots, lemons, etc., and insist on drinking enough water, which is beneficial to physical health and also helps to enhance the baby's resistance. Fourth, avoid smoke, second-hand smoke and air pollutants, these harmful substances will stimulate the baby's respiratory tract, causing the baby to cough frequently. Fifth, the baby's body needs sufficient sleep to maintain normal functioning. Enough sleep also helps to enhance the baby's resistance and reduce the chance of the baby getting sick. In addition, keep the indoor air fresh, exhaust the kitchen smoke, and parents should not smoke in the house. Ventilate regularly. The indoor humidity should be appropriate, an overly dry environment, the air humidity drops, the mucosa dries and becomes brittle, small blood vessels may rupture and bleed, ciliary movement is restricted, which can easily lead to dry cough. Therefore, when indoors, it is appropriate to maintain a certain humidity. In fact, this is not difficult. When the climate is dry, you can often use a damp mop to mop the floor, or sprinkle some water on the floor. Or place a humidifier at home, but be sure to wash it regularly. Adjust the room temperature, add or reduce clothes for the baby in time. 25℃~28℃ is the most comfortable room temperature. When the baby has a dry cough, spicy foods such as chili, pepper, and ginger should be avoided. These foods stimulate the respiratory tract and worsen the cough, so they should be avoided. Fresh vegetables such as greens, carrots, tomatoes, etc., can provide a variety of vitamins and inorganic salts, which are beneficial to the recovery of body metabolic function, and the baby can eat more. Drinking more water can promote urination and remove bacteria from the body, which can prevent colds and coughs. In addition, mothers should let children exercise appropriately. Strengthen the child's physique, adapt to the cold and dry environment in winter.\n"

For round face, you can choose to layer the front hair area to break the round feeling, and use hard-textured accessories to lengthen the face ratio. For square face, you can choose to wear hair accessories upward, draw threads on the outer contour to enhance the center of the face, use soft outward curls to neutralize the toughness of the face, and retract the hair ends inward to modify the jaw line. For long face, you can choose to pull the face ratio horizontally on both sides, weaken the presence of the forehead, control the height of the top of the head, focus on the fullness of the two ends, use full backward curling to handle the bangs, extend the hair ends outward in the middle of the face to balance the face shape, and use earrings to horizontally lift the visual shortening of the face shape. For heart-shaped face, avoid heavy straight bangs, use outward curls, air bangs and eight-character bangs to modify, and increase the sense of volume of the lower jaw. For pear-shaped face, use curly hair to increase the volume of the lower half of the face to balance the facial proportions, whether it's big wavy curls, loose curls, or compact curls, can make the pear-shaped face more balanced.\n"

You can put the cat house in a sunny place and let the cat sunbathe more during the day, which can also promote calcium absorption. Second, due to the cold weather in winter, the cat's appetite will increase. At this time, we should control the feeding amount and appropriately increase the food.

As an owner, it is best to tease it to exercise for a while every day, which can enhance physical fitness and prevent excessive weight gain. Also, the cat house in winter is best placed in a sunny place, sunbathe more, especially important for kittens and elderly cats, can prevent rickets and osteoporosis. When taking the cat out in winter, it is best to dress them, choose clothes that only wear the front legs. Cats are different from dogs, they don't like to wear all four legs, it is not convenient for them to move. Finally, many pet owners in winter have overlooked the cat's cat house, causing the cat to catch a cold and get sick. In winter, you must pay attention to adjusting the position of the cat house, put it in a place where the wind is avoided indoors, and properly prepare some thick pads to keep the cat warm.\n"

This is exactly where these BackBackGoods squeeze. On the other hand, this squeezing on the back will cause the scapula to retract and move the entire chest cavity, creating shear force and compensation.

        "query": "Can I wash my hair?\nDuring the confinement period, there is indeed a controversy about whether to wash hair and bathe. However, according to the current understanding, mothers can wash their hair and bathe after a certain period of time after delivery. For example, mothers who have given birth vaginally can wash their hair and bathe 1 week after discharge, and mothers who have undergone cesarean section are recommended to bathe 10~15 days after delivery, but they must pay attention to waterproofing the wound to prevent infection. Generally speaking, according to the body's recovery, the general vaginal delivery can wash hair a week after, and two weeks after cesarean delivery. In addition, it's not hygienic and unscientific to not wash your hair in such hot weather during the confinement period, it's easy to breed bacteria and it's not good for health. Therefore, you can wash your hair 1~2 weeks after delivery, but you need to pay attention to the following when washing your hair after delivery: Firstly, you should pay attention to cleaning the scalp when washing your hair. Secondly, the water temperature for washing hair must be appropriate, not too cold or too hot. The hair is more oily after delivery, and it is also easy to lose hair, so don't use too stimulating shampoo. Finally, after washing your hair, you should dry your hair in time, use a hair dryer to dry it, and avoid catching cold.\n"

Mature forest tea trees mainly use light trimming and deep trimming measures to maintain the vigorous growth of tea trees and the neat crown picking surface, ensuring tea yield and quality. Aging tea trees mainly use heavy pruning and terracing measures, combined with shaping pruning and top-light picking to rejuvenate the tea tree crown. In terms of picking, there are standard picking, timely picking, batch multiple picking, and leaf retention picking. Hand picking includes pinching (breaking), straight picking, double-hand picking, and machine picking. The trimming time is generally in mid-to-late April for Longjing 43 tea garden. The spring tea can be pruned immediately after picking. At this time, it is generally heavy repair. The lower the cut, the stronger the bud will be next year. But if the cut is too low, the yield will be low next year. Therefore, pruning is also a technical activity.

The higher this content, the less other sugar and vegetable oil can be added to the chocolate, the healthier the chocolate. Second, look at the hardness and milk fat content. Pure chocolate, such as dark chocolate, has high hardness and less milk fat than milk chocolate, and contains less salt. In addition, we need to distinguish 'cocoa butter' and 'cocoa butter substitute'. Some chocolates, the so-called dark chocolates made with cocoa butter substitutes instead of cocoa beans, don't buy them! Cocoa butter substitute is a type of artificially hydrogenated vegetable oil, it has no nutritional value at all, it will increase bad cholesterol, lower good cholesterol, increase blood viscosity, and thus form thrombus. Finally, we need to pay attention to the packaging, appearance, taste and texture of the product. The genuine product will be softer at room temperature, and needs to be frozen in the refrigerator, because it was frozen after softening, so there are some flaws. The taste and texture of the genuine product are more like raw chocolate, and the filling turns into liquid in your mouth. The overall entrance has a bit of bitter taste, but it is very mellow aftertaste, it doesn't feel bitter, and I still want to eat it after eating.\n"

First, you can cleverly use screens and curtains. Opening windows can make the air circulate, but it may also cause the room to fill with dust. Installing a layer of screen or curtain on the window can effectively prevent sand and dust from entering the room, breathe fresh air. Secondly, you can use flowers and plants to help. Some plants have dustproof, detoxifying, air-purifying abilities, which can be placed indoors to achieve a dustproof effect. In addition, you can seal doors and windows simply. The aging of window seals will cause a large amount of dust to enter the room, and sticking glass seals around the window glass can prevent dust from entering the room through gaps. Finally, you can use a door and window special seal, a light sticker, which can achieve wind leakage, dust, noise prevention, anti-collision, and solve many problems caused by window gaps.\n"

If the frenulum is too short or too tight, the baby may have difficulty extending or moving the tongue. In addition, if the baby has difficulty sucking during feeding, insufficient milk intake, or frequent regurgitation, it may also be a sign that the frenulum is too tight."

        "query": "What should we do if the baby's frenulum is too tight?\nIf the baby's frenulum is too tight, there are two main surgical methods to consider. One is the traditional method, which is to cut with a knife. This method is fast and can be operated in the hospital at birth, but it may cause more pain and the recovery period may be longer. Another method is to use a dentist's laser. This method causes less pain and recovers faster, but if the laser is not thorough, it may need to be done again, and insurance may not cover it, and the cost is about $800. After the operation, you need to do stretching exercises, such as stretching the baby's mouth every 4 hours, and revisit in a week. If the revisit shows that the stretching is not done well, the doctor may reopen the wound under the baby's tongue, and it may cause a lot of blood. Therefore, it is recommended to do the stretching exercises seriously after the operation, and also seek help from a chiropractor and lactation consultant.\n"

When the liver is damaged, bile secretion is reduced, affecting food digestion, and patients will have a series of symptoms, such as reduced appetite, diarrhea and indigestion.

First, you can use a small amount of water to evenly dip a circle of dumplings in the palm of your hand, and the surface powder will open. Then, gently knead it again. During the cooking process, you need to pay attention to the following points: 1. Put the dumplings in the pot when the pot bottom bubbles. When you see small bubbles coming out of the bottom of the pot, you can put the dumplings in the pot, slightly push the dumplings with the back of the spoon in one direction so that they are not squeezed together, and then use high heat to boil the water. 2. After the pot is boiled, pour in a bowl of cold water, continue to gently stir along the edge of the pot, and be careful not to touch the dumplings. After boiling, add a bowl of cold water again, repeat the operation, add cold water three times in total. Cook until the dumplings float. 3. Take out the frozen dumplings, put them in a large bowl, soak in cold water for 20-30 seconds, and they will not crack due to sudden heat after entering the pot. 4. First boil water in the pot, then pour the dumplings into the pot after the water is boiled. The key point is not to touch it when you cook it. If it is sticking together, you can gently separate them at this time. Then quietly wait for them to float up, and you can immediately scoop them out to cool down after the water boils twice. Finally, put them in the water with ice cubes after a while. Soak it, usually for 3-4 hours, you can change the water in the meantime.\n"

On the other hand, biguanide drugs, such as metformin, are cheap, cost-effective, safe, do not cause hypoglycemia when used alone, less likely to cause lactic acid poisoning compared with Diabex.

When extending backwards, the intervertebral space narrows and the intervertebral disc is squeezed, and most patients have more obvious limitations when extending backwards. In severe cases, lumbar vertebrae can have burst fractures, usually fractures will more or less cause some pressure or damage to the cauda equina nerves, resulting in partial paralysis of the lower limbs, or completely paralyzed.

        "query": "Besides when lying down, are there any other situations that can cause a cat's eyes to become round?\nIn addition to when lying down, there are many other situations that can cause a cat's eyes to become round. For example, when the cat is affected by the intensity of light, such as during the day, the pupil of the cat is mostly in the shape of a line to reduce the amount of light entering and avoid injury to the eyes. At night when the light is relatively weak, the pupils will fully dilate into a round shape to collect more light to help see objects clearly, which helps with nocturnal activities or hunting. Also, when the cat feels curious or focused, their pupils will become round and large, making it easier to observe. When the cat feels relaxed, it will become a suitable size. When the cat's pupils are fully dilated, it means that it has been strongly stimulated, possibly excited, scared or fearful. At this time, try to soothe it to calm it down. When the cat's mood becomes tense and depressed, its pupils will shrink, and at this time it may become aggressive, so don't provoke it at this time! The changes in a cat's pupils can be roughly divided into three types: round, oval, and linear. When the cat is in an environment where the light changes or the cat's own emotions change, the size of the cat's pupils will also change accordingly.\n"

The distance of staggered seams should be larger, so it is easier when pulling. Also, the adjustment range should not be too large, otherwise it will easily deform severely. In addition, you can refer to the experience of reducing the size of the T-shirt collar, which has been reduced by about 1.5 cm.

Join a candidate group in advance, candidates who have taken the exam will share this year's new test points and structured questions in it, you can prepare according to others' preparation, the possibility of testing repeated questions is not small.

As the saying goes, 'Don't move the pen and ink without reading', I hope you can keep such good habits; it seems that students have mastered it very firmly; this student's speech is very logical, do you think he is right; the second group The collected information is very accurate, very good, please sit; the girls in the last row raised their hands early, then please answer this question; there are many posts on the Internet that can be used for reference, you don't need to learn each one, find a few lines to form your own fixed match , You can use it no matter which knowledge point you match. If you don't want to stare at the examiner during the trial lecture, you can choose to stare at the wall in front, but occasionally you should look at the walls on both sides, and it is best to look at the examiner when asking questions during the trial lecture. The voice of the lecture must be loud, even if a sentence is wrong, it can be corrected immediately, don't feel unconfident because of a wrong sentence, after all, real teachers will also stutter when lecturing. Remember to say hello to the examiner when you try to lecture, and then report your candidate number. Remember not to say your name! Don't walk back and forth on the podium, don't kick your feet front and back (some people have the habit of kicking when standing), when pointing to the blackboard or projector, the gesture should be generous, don't appear to want to point and dare not. When inviting students to answer questions, you can also bring some gestures. Finally, remember to write on the blackboard! Don't just focus on lecturing in front.\n"

However, hand soap is not suitable for washing the face, as it may cause certain irritation to the skin and may lead to symptoms of dry skin. This is because hand soap has a relatively strong ability to remove dirt, and it can easily overclean the oil and moisture on the skin surface, causing the skin on the face to feel dry or tight. In severe cases, it may cause damage to the skin on the face. Therefore, although hand soap is less irritating to the skin, it is not suitable for washing the face.\n"

The ideal state is that the cat does not bite or scratch people, interacts easily, is not nervous or hiding, adapts to visitors, is not overly excited or scared, gets along harmoniously with other cats, is not overly nervous when going out, and masters some tricks to coax people. Secondly, we need to correct the cat's bad habits, such as rummaging through the trash, randomly biting people, scratching claws, urinating and defecating randomly, running around at night, and picky eating. For example, if the cat bites people, we can stuff its throat with our fingers or lightly bite its ears, try not to tease the kitten with our hands. In addition, we can give the cat something to do, divert its attention, eliminate the previous feedback we gave to the cat for playing, let the cat feel that biting us is not fun, but the game is fun. Finally, we need to enrich the environment, divert the cat's attention to us, spend time interacting with the cat, play with it with a cat teaser, play away from our bodies. During the training period, we can wear thicker pants, those who bite people can prepare a knee protector for horse riding.

        "query": "How effective is laser therapy?\nLaser therapy is an effective treatment method for scars. For example, the fractional CO2 laser can vaporize the scar into a grid structure pattern, reducing the volume of the scar and restoring the collagen structure to a more orderly arrangement. The combination of fractional CO2 laser and surgical reconstruction has become an effective treatment method. The fractional laser can control the symptoms of the scar and reduce the probability of later surgical treatment. In addition, the pulsed dye laser has the best effect on reducing angiogenesis, erythema, tenderness and itching of immature new scars. The pulsed dye laser enhances and supplements the reconstruction procedure by reducing tension and reducing scar thickness. In addition, the mechanism of ablative fractional CO2 laser can increase dermal flexibility, improve abnormal texture, reduce scar thickness, and promote scar maturation. These two mechanisms can be combined to synergistically treat hypertrophic burn scars. In addition, laser treatment can reduce postoperative morbidity and improve overall prognosis. The laser has two functions, one is to promote collagen remodeling, and the other is to allow the scar surface to peel off, making the scar flatter and smaller. After laser treatment, it can improve the color, texture, and elasticity of the scar, making it closer to normal skin. Overall, the laser beauty treatment commonly used for the effective treatment of scars is a comprehensive treatment mainly based on carbon dioxide fractional laser, which is currently a more effective method for treating scars.\n"

For stomach diseases, the choice of sleeping position will also affect the recovery of the disease. For example, for stomach ulcers, gastritis, and stomach hypomotility, it is recommended to sleep in the right lateral position. For gastroesophageal reflux, it is recommended to sleep in the left lateral position. In addition, the most suitable sleeping position for stomach pain should be supine, and it can also be combined with hot compress to relieve pain. Relatively speaking, the right lateral position is the most suitable and comfortable sleeping position for the body's blood supply. This position allows the body to naturally bend, the organs to stay in their natural position, the heart to be in a high position without being oppressed and the liver to be in a low position. This can ensure good blood supply, and is also beneficial to the metabolism and healthy operation of the gastrointestinal tract.\n"

For example, you can use a transparent waterproof bandage to fix the loose screws. Firstly, cut a narrow strip along with the backing paper of the bandage, then tear a small hole, start to pull into the place where the screw is loose, tear off the backing paper while winding. Another method is to use a special screwdriver to adjust the screws of the frame. If it's easy to damage, you can go to the eyeglasses store directly. If both sides are loose, generally bending the bridge inwardly a bit can do. The leg of the glasses is easy to loosen, need to adjust the screw that connects the leg and the frame. Tighten it clockwise with a screwdriver, don’t tighten it too much to damage the frame. After adjusting, move the leg by hand, try if the tightness is suitable, you can also try to wear it, and then fine-tune it. The nose pad is easy to feel loose, mainly because it can't hold the bridge of the nose, it's too downward, you can move the metal wire of the bridge of the nose, adjust the tightness inwardly a bit. Finally, we need to check whether the screw of the leg is loose and adjust it in time, and see if there is a phenomenon of expanding outward on the legs. If so, we need to heat the legs with a hair dryer, the temperature should not be too hot, simply heat for a few seconds, and then reshape it!\n"

This is because the fingertip ab point is the easiest place to break, it is the stress surface of the nail. After the nails grow out of the nail bed, they will turn white, which is a sign of moisture loss.

Therefore, when we use cuticle oil, we can drop it on our fingertips, let it fully nourish the dehydrated nails and ab point, effectively increase the toughness of the nail, not easy to break and repair damaged nails. In addition, the nourishing oil mainly contains hydrolyzed wheat protein + calcium pantothenate + sweet almond + Australian nut and other magic ingredients, it can repair damaged nails, prolong the nail bed, and smooth the hangnails. The effect of nourishing the cuticle is first-class. Now I use it as a base oil when I do manicure, and it is shiny after applying it.\n"

First, it could be due to hereditary factors, which means that the color of the areola is largely influenced by hereditary genes. Second, it could be due to physiological factors, such as sexual maturity and lactation. As women gradually begin to show secondary sexual characteristics, the color of the areola gradually deepens from the tender pink of girlhood. With sexual maturity and lactation, women will have more pigment deposition in these private parts, causing the skin color to darken. Lastly, it could be due to wearing rough underwear. The rough material of the underwear continuously rubbing against the areola causes melanin to deposit. However, if you find that not only the color of your areola has deepened, but also there are some small nodules on the areola gland, it is recommended that you contact your doctor promptly and have your liver function checked at the hospital.\n"

However, if the sound of bones occurs frequently, it may be caused by joint injury, disease or structural variation, resulting in rough synovium, loose joint capsule, ligament relaxation, tendon hyperplasia or tendon sheath stenosis, joint disc rupture, joint cartilage shedding, etc. during movement due to joint tissue friction popping sound.

        "query": "Did these revolutions have any negative impacts?\nThe French Revolution and the Russian October Revolution did indeed have some negative impacts. Firstly, the conflict between the source of power of parliament and party system and the people who hand over power to these representatives led to the emergence of many popular autonomous institutions. After Robespierre came to power, he declared war on them under the pretext of defending the unity and indivisibility of the French nation. The Jacobins tried to put civil society under their control, so the various civil organizations of the republic “were crushed by the central government, not because they posed a substantial threat, but because they were competitors of public power as long as they existed for one day”. Secondly, power will be too concentrated in the center. Any revolution cannot avoid destroying the balance of power for the benefit of the central government. The main reason may be that a new government is needed to defend against internal or external enemies. This requires good coordination capabilities and a single power center, in which military and economic issues stand out, and the political agenda is put behind. Lastly, external intervention is the reason for the failure of the revolution, which will have a negative impact on the progress of the revolution. For example, the failure of the Hungarian Revolution was not due to internal factors, but to the suppression of the Soviet army.\n"

After using a color, the brush head should be washed with water, squeezed dry, and then the next color. Secondly, you need to master the skills of color mixing, first lay out the main color (inherent color) paint on the palette, and then gradually add other colors around the inherent color of the object to form a rich color series that is related and differentiated. In addition, the steps for coloring are: background-table and lining-main object. When painting the main object, start from the light surface, first paint the fixed color, adjust the inherent color, pay attention to the same object should be bright near, slightly dark far away, forming a color space order. If you find that the color is not accurate or the area is not appropriate after painting, don't rush to change it, wait until it is completely dry, and then correct it through coverage. Finally, adjustment can start from the overall coloring, the overall color, gradually and step by step to deepen. Never finish painting an object all at once!! Wait until the entire object parts, gray parts, and dark parts are completed, then deepen the darkest, brighten the brightest, and enhance the gray to achieve a coordinated overall picture effect.\n"

        ],
        "query": "Are there any precautions for soaking feet?\nThere are several precautions for soaking feet. Firstly, the time of soaking feet should not be too long, it is best to control within 15--20 minutes. If the time is too long, the local blood circulation of the feet will be too fast for a long time, and more blood in the body will flow to the lower limbs, which will cause cardiovascular overload. Secondly, the water temperature should not be too high. The best water temperature for soaking feet is below 50℃, and it is required to be hot but not scalding. Don't measure the water temperature with your hands, it is best to feel it with your feet. If the water temperature is too high, the blood vessels on the feet are prone to excessive dilation, more blood in the body flows to the lower limbs, which can easily cause insufficient blood supply to important organs such as the heart, brain, and kidneys, which is not good for the body. In addition, it is not advisable to soak feet within half an hour after a meal, which will affect the blood supply to the stomach, and in the long run, it will cause malnutrition. You can't go to sleep immediately after soaking feet. Rub the soles of your feet while your feet are hot, put on socks in time to keep warm, and wait for the body temperature to slowly decrease before going to sleep for the best effect. Finally, it is best to use a deep wooden barrel or enamel basin for soaking feet, which allows the feet to be comfortably placed flat inside, and the water should always soak up to the calves.\n"

This small filtering bucket is usually a non-powered bucket, mainly used for physical filtering. Its main role is to increase the filtering space. After adding the pre-filtering bucket, the physical filtration and biochemical filtration are separated. The filter cotton is placed in the pre-filtering bucket, and the main bucket is filled with filter material, which is equivalent to increasing the filtering space and enhancing the filtration effect. In addition, the pre-filtering bucket is easy to maintain. Just clean the pre-filtering bucket, and most of the filtering buckets flow water from bottom to top, which means that the physical filtration is at the bottom of the filtering bucket. This means that each time you clean the filter cotton, you need to take out all the filter materials in the entire filtering bucket to clean the bottom filter cotton, and it is too troublesome to operate like this every time. So add a pre-filter, put all the filter cotton in the pre-filter bucket, and you only need to clean the pre-filter during maintenance, and you don't need to open the main bucket, which is more convenient.\n"

        ],
        "query": "So how is the air cushion comb installed?\nThe installation of the air cushion comb requires some steps. First, you need to put the comb tooth straight into the hole, and the tip of the cone is stuffed in. It must be in the right position, if it goes in obliquely, it is likely to slip out of the hole, and then you scratch the intact air cushion. After placing it right, start to draw a circle with the tail of the comb tooth. It's not the self-rotation of the comb tooth, it's the revolution around the upright virtual shadow of the comb tooth. You can think of the dance movements like \"draw a dragon on the left for you, and draw a Guo Fucheng on the right\". The most important condition for drawing a circle is that you must maintain a downward force. This step is a bit difficult because the air cushion is leaking. You feel like there is no space to stab down when you stab the air cushion to the bottom. But on the contrary, you have to hit it harder and hit it while drawing a circle, so that the big butt of the cone is always shaking left and right looking for an opportunity to stuff in. Be careful not to break the comb tooth when drawing a circle. The comb tooth is quite fragile. When I used metal tweezers to pull it out, I accidentally left some irreversible scars. When drawing a circle, you can wrap the tail of the comb tooth with a wet tissue to prevent it from slipping. Be sure to stare at the tip of the comb tooth cone to make sure it is in the hole. If it can't go in no matter how you shake it, the force to hit down is a little bit bigger. If the position of the hole is not open, there are other comb teeth blocking the way, you can brutally push away other comb teeth to leave space. This kind of violent combing of comb teeth for a short time will not really hurt the comb.\n"

However, when pregnant women practice yoga, they need to pay attention to some precautions and taboos to ensure their own and baby's safety and health. First, seek the advice and guidance of a doctor. Before starting prenatal yoga practice, it is recommended to consult with a doctor to understand your own physical condition and the situation of the baby, to ensure that you can practice yoga safely. Second, avoid overstretching. Although yoga can help relieve physical discomfort, pregnant women should avoid overstretching the body to prevent strain or other injuries. Especially in the later stages of pregnancy, the pregnant woman's body will become more and more unstable, so avoid too drastic actions. Third, avoid doing flat lying yoga movements. In the late stage of pregnancy, the supine position may increase uterine pressure and affect the health of the fetus. Therefore, pregnant women should avoid flat lying movements as much as possible when practicing yoga, especially sit-ups and movements with greater abdominal pressure. Fourth, avoid over panting during yoga practice. Over panting can lead to rapid breathing, affecting the oxygen supply of the fetus. Therefore, pregnant women should pay attention to the rhythm of breathing when practicing yoga, and avoid over panting. Fifth, pay attention to food and water intake. Before and after practicing yoga, pregnant women should pay attention to proper food and water intake to avoid physical discomfort or dehydration. It is recommended to drink a moderate amount of water before and after practice, and to eat appropriately after practice to replenish physical strength.\n"

Drinking a lot of water every day, urinating once every 2~3 hours, can prevent the proliferation of bacteria in the urinary tract, and can reduce the incidence of urinary tract infections. Secondly, pay attention to personal hygiene, a large number of bacteria live in the female genitalia and the mouth of the urethra, which is a prerequisite for urinary tract infections. Therefore, you should often pay attention to the cleanliness of the genitals, take more baths, and change your underwear frequently. In addition, try to avoid using urinary tract infection equipment and catheterization, because urinary tract equipment can easily bring bacteria from the distant end of the urethra into the bladder and upper urinary tract, and persistent bacteriuria is easy to occur after catheterization of the urinary tract. Finally, remove chronic infection factors, such as diabetes, chronic kidney disease, hypertension, and low body resistance, all of which are prone to urinary tract infections.\n"

Secondly, don't believe anything about stewing, the fast cooking in the middle, you don't need to cover the pot, the same rice grains bloom, first: it is not easy to spill the pot, especially the main fat of the rice oil layer will not be spilled out, second is not to let the porridge in the pot be white by the steamed rice soup and rice oil. In addition, when boiling porridge, put enough water in the pot, try not to add water halfway. First boil the water, then put in the washed millet, and boil it. Just after the rice is put, you need to stir the pot from time to time to prevent it from sticking to the bottom, otherwise the porridge will taste bad. Then, turn to low heat, simmer with gentle heat, and try to lift the lid as little as possible when simmering with gentle heat. The boiling time must be enough, at least half an hour, when all the millets are burst open, the soup becomes sticky, you can turn off the heat. Another tip is to wash the millet clean, wash the millet only need to wash 3 times, wash off the surface of the rice powder, the water becomes clear. Let the washed millet soak in cold water for about half an hour, the rice grains will swell, making the taste of millet porridge more pure. When washing millet, stir in a clockwise direction, so the rice grains will become light and will taste better! Boiling millet porridge requires a lot of patience, the first step is to boil the porridge on high heat, keep stirring for about 5 minutes, then turn to medium heat, keep stirring. Because stirring will produce friction, which makes the millet porridge sticky. Finally, turn to low heat, cover the pot for 10 minutes, and the delicious millet porridge is ready.\n"

Secondly, regularly change the brush head, which can also better protect the waterproof ring. In addition, to prevent the formation of mold, keeping dry and ventilated is the key, avoid contacting water sources, and avoid exposure to the sun. After each brushing, pay attention to rinsing the gap of the toothbrush installation with clean water to avoid leaving excess toothpaste and causing the waterproof pad to age. Finally, be sure to clean the toothbrush after brushing your teeth to avoid toothpaste residue. Because toothpaste has a corrosive effect, after a long time, it will soak the waterproof ring, and then the toothpaste and water will drive straight in the brush handle, causing damage to the toothbrush circuit and other problems.\n"

First, the most effective way to supplement collagen protein is still through oral collagen protein, but be careful, if you feel it does not work, maybe the molecular weight of the collagen protein you drink is too large, so you must choose collagen peptide to drink, which has a small molecular weight. Secondly, in the products that can be called collagen peptide, there are also peptides with too large molecular weight, such as 500-2000 Dalton collagen peptide is better absorbed than 1, 2,000 Dalton collagen protein. Therefore, it is recommended to choose 500-2000 Dalton collagen peptide for consumption, because its molecular weight is small, it can be easily decomposed into amino acids by protease in the intestine, and quickly absorbed by the body. In addition, when choosing collagen protein, you need to identify the official raw material brand authorization, clear addition amount, and identify the raw material patent or clinical trial. Finally, the method of consumption is to add 50-100mg milk or VC-containing juice or warm water for daily consumption.\n"

Among them, oligomeric proanthocyanidins OPC is the most effective. Therefore, when choosing grape seeds, you must check the OPC content. If the product does not indicate the OPC content on the label, it is not recommended. In addition, the core effective ingredient in grape seeds is oligomeric proanthocyanidins OPC, so the label of grape seed products needs to look at two contents, one is the content of grape seeds, and the other is the content of proanthocyanidins, both of which are indispensable.\n"

You can also judge your exercise intensity by your heart rate. For example, low-intensity exercise, the maximum heart rate is about 220-degree age, and the heart rate is 40%～55% of the maximum heart rate; medium-intensity exercise, the heart rate is 55%～75% of the maximum heart rate; high-intensity exercise, the heart rate is above 75% of the maximum heart rate for high-intensity exercise.\n"

The method of use is as follows: First, remove the cap of the trap, and remove the top layer of the trap; Second, put bait or some food that roaches like in the middle and four corners of the trap; Third, after the bait is put in, cover the top and cap; Fourth, place the trap in the dark corners where roaches love to appear. After the bait is used up, bread, pastries, meat floss, sesame oil, dried fish shrimp and other sweet foods can be used as bait, the more fragrant the food, the better the effect, other baits can be tried directly.\n"

For example, an electrocardiogram can intuitively see if there are arrhythmias, myocardial ischemia, and other changes, but it cannot directly observe whether the coronary artery is narrow. Similarly, echocardiography can check the structure and function of the heart, but it cannot see the condition of the coronary arteries, so it cannot directly detect coronary heart disease. If you highly suspect coronary heart disease, you can consider performing coronary CTA or coronary angiography, which can directly observe whether the coronary artery is narrow, and can perform therapeutic interventional operations during the operation, such as stent implantation and balloon dilation.\n"

        "query": "How should I adjust if I use fresh beans?\nIf you use fresh beans, you can adjust the grinder according to the following steps: First, you need to clean the residual powder in the grinder channel, because the coffee powder left in the grinder channel overnight will affect the flavor and extraction parameters due to long exposure to air. Then, weigh 18 grams of coffee powder, then put the coffee powder into our coffee handle and take a look at its extraction state. The golden cup extraction ratio of most Italian blend coffee beans is 1:2, which means 18g of coffee powder extracts 36g of concentrate, and the time is controlled at about 25-30 seconds. If the coffee machine extracts too quickly, it will result in insufficient extraction, acidic taste, short aftertaste, and insufficient aroma. So in the case of fixed powder quantity, we need to adjust the grinding degree finer; similarly, if the same coffee powder flow rate is too slow, we can also adjust the grinding degree coarser, basically within the golden cup interval. Finally, when we adjust the scale of the grinder, we need to ask for adjustment, we can only adjust one small grid at a time.\n"

Can you give me some more details?\nIf you want to try curly hair, here are some simple and quick methods you can refer to. First, you need to completely dry your hair, then start curling the ends of your hair in layers. Use hair wax to shape the ends of your hair in the first step, then use hair gel to shape, slightly adjust, and you're done. If your hair is soft and thin, you still need to use a hair dryer to blow up the roots of your hair, then use a small curling iron, a small clip to clip the roots + middle of your hair, and then curl the ends backwards. When choosing a curling wand and clip, for short hair, choose small, narrow tools, otherwise large ones are hard to use and can easily burn your hands. The temperature of the curling wand is also very important, for hard hair, you need a higher temperature, otherwise it is very hard. You can divide your hair into 4 areas first, then use the curling wand to curl the hair in the opposite direction of the earth, the curling strength and length gradually decrease from 1-4, it's best to only curl the ends in area 4. After curling, press down the hair on both temples. Then take an appropriate amount of hair wax in the palm of your hand, rub it evenly and then apply it to all the hair. Finally, if your hair is as hard as mine, you can spray hair gel after, and then use the curling wand to curl again according to the above steps, with the base of styling spray and hair wax, after curling again, even if the hair is as hard as steel wire, it can be shaped according to the direction you want, finally use hair wax to adjust the direction of the hair, spray a layer of styling spray.\n"

In addition, prefer fertile and slightly acidic sandy soil, you can evenly mix some coarse sand and decomposed fertilizer in some garden soil. Gloxinia is native to Brazil and is not cold-resistant. The suitable growth temperature is 20 to 25°C. When the winter temperature drops to about 5°C, Gloxinia will be dormant, and when the summer temperature exceeds 30°C, the plant will be semi-dormant. Before blooming, you need to apply nitrogen fertilizer once a week, and after the flower buds form, you need to increase the application of phosphorus fertilizer. During the fertilization process, you should also pay attention not to get the leaves, you can spray some clean water appropriately after fertilizing, clean the leaves, but pay attention to the residual water, it should be dealt with as soon as possible to avoid corrosion. Finally, the flowers cannot be directly exposed to the sun, the leaves cannot touch water, water when the leaves are wilting, and after the flowers have just finished blooming, trim the old leaves at the bottom, and new flower buds will grow next month.\n"

In addition, Da Shichang, born on September 26, 1940, in Shanghai, hometown in Nanjing, Jiangsu Province, graduated from the acting department of Shanghai Film Academy. In 1962, he starred in the film 'A Young Generation'. In 1975, he starred in the film 'Spring Bud'. In 1980, he starred in the film 'Swallow Returns', winning the best actor award at the 4th Popular Film Hundred Flowers Award. In 1984, he starred in the film 'Tan Sitong'. In 1986, he won the Society Award of the first China Film Performing Arts Society Golden Phoenix Award for the film '84·85 in T Province'. In the same year, he won the best male dubbing actor award at the 4th China TV Golden Eagle Award for the dubbed TV series 'Rose Strait'. In 2017, he won the special honor award at the 16th China Film Performing Arts Society Golden Phoenix Award. Another example is Chen Lizi, born in poverty and started from scratch, but he not only gained recognition from his peers, but even turned opponents into partners, becoming a legend in the business world. This is because he values righteousness over profit, makes money that should be made, and has a fair way of acquiring wealth. There are also 5 historical figures in China. They were all born poor but eventually achieved great things. These include Mao Zedong, Confucius, Sun Yat-sen, Jack Ma, and Zhu Yuanzhang. Their stories show that as long as you are determined and never give up, anything is possible.\n"

Whether it was Germany II, Weimar, Germany III, West Germany, East Germany or after reunification, the currency was always called the Mark. The Mark introduced today is the last set of West Germany, the only set after the reunification of the two Germanys, and the last set of Mark circulating banknotes in German history. The West German Mark used for as long as 30 years in the 1960 edition was issued on October 1, 1990 (3 days before the reunification of the two Germanys, but the East German had already introduced the West German Mark). The German Mark was the currency in circulation in Germany before the Euro was used in 2002. It was first issued in West Germany after World War II in 1948 and became the currency of the Federal Republic of Germany after the reunification of East and West Germany. This coin is a currency Mark issued in 1983, manufactured by Karlsruhe, now worth 0.51 Euros. The Mark was the legal currency of Germany before the Euro was used in 2002, first issued in Germany under Allied occupation in 1948 to replace the original Imperial Mark, and subsequently served as the legal currency of the Federal Republic of Germany until it was replaced by the Euro in 1999.\n"

In addition, if your finger size doesn't change often, then choosing a non-resizable ring can also save you some money, because resizable rings usually cost more than non-resizable ones.\n"

Finally, you can try to first blanch the mutton with green onions and ginger, and skim off the foam; then add the mutton and radish to a pressure cooker and stew for 30 minutes; finally, melt the hot pot base on low heat, add green onions, ginger, garlic, chili, cinnamon, star anise and stir-fry, then add the stewed mutton.\n"

The magnetic function is also worry-free for daily use with a magnetic power bank🔋. CASETiFY is increasingly known for its good drop resistance. In terms of lens frame, casetify also leaves a small distance to achieve the effect of lens drop resistance. At the same time, compared with other brands of phone cases, the thickness of the front frame of casetify will increase accordingly, which also increases the weight of the case itself. Finally, the price of casetify is relatively high compared to similar products. It is an acceptable range for friends who pay attention to the drop resistance of phone cases and the cost-effectiveness of products.\n"

Aquamarine can be divided into 9 grades from high to low quality: light blue in stone form, deep blue in stone form, semi-transparent light blue, shiny light blue, semi-transparent sky blue, semi-transparent water blue, shiny cat's eye, transparent water blue, pure water blue. If the color is pure and bright, and there are no flaws inside, it is of high quality. Aquamarine symbolizes calmness, bravery, and intelligence, and is known as the \"stone of love\". Wearing aquamarine can enhance self-confidence, relieve stress, and make people feel relaxed. In ancient times, people found that aquamarine is like a pool of clear water, blue as the ocean, perfectly combining appearance and inner quality, hence the name \"aquamarine\". Aquamarine can help to calm the mind and clarify thoughts, enhance personal communication skills, strengthen personal confidence, and moisturize the skin. It's recommended to wear the aquamarine on the left hand according to the principle of 'enter from the left and exit from the right'. As a tip, you can wear it with rose quartz or clear quartz to increase their complementary effects. Aquamarine can help relieve fatigue, massage the skin, and improve people's spirits. Wearing aquamarine can also enhance a person's temperament, highlighting a unique personal charm. Aquamarine can also have a skincare effect.

After the athlete receives a warning, if he commits the same offense again, he will be shown both a yellow card and a red card, and the opponent will be judged to score one point. The second time he commits the same offense, the referee can judge the opponent to score two points, and also show both a yellow and red card.

Firstly, they do not protrude, making the appearance of the phone case look less bulky, and they can also play a drop-resistant role. Secondly, the four-corner drop-resistant airbag is the biggest highlight of this mobile phone case. Once the phone slips from your hand, it can securely protect every corner and prevent the phone from being accidentally injured. In addition, the four corners also have air cushions, which can effectively prevent the phone from being damaged when it falls.\n"

Especially for scores close to pass, you will pass directly after the review is successful. Secondly, if the course has a make-up exam opportunity, you can apply for a make-up exam to the school. After the application is approved, you need to pay attention to the school email notification and remember the specific date and time of the make-up exam. But it should be noted that: the highest score of the make-up exam can only reach the passing score. In addition, if your course does not give final grades, but shows a 'Nil' or 'RW', which means that the teacher still needs to investigate your final grades, you need to respond in a timely and positive manner. If you are not satisfied with the Show Cause results, or the school refuses your reply, you can appeal to fight for all rights and interests.

On the other hand, if the tire pressure is too low, it may increase friction, thereby increasing power consumption, and the steering may become heavy, and there is also a risk of tire burst. Both high and low tire pressure will affect driving safety. In addition, high tire pressure may cause the friction and adhesion of the tire to decrease, affecting the braking effect; cause the steering wheel to vibrate and deviate, reducing the comfort of driving, increasing the vibration of the car body, indirectly affecting the life of other parts; accelerate the partial wear of the central pattern of the tire surface, reducing the life of the tire; and reduce the rolling resistance. Low tire pressure may increase the friction coefficient with the road, accelerating tire wear and aging, and increasing fuel consumption; cause the steering wheel to be heavy and prone to deviation and other factors that are detrimental to driving safety; the friction between the tire and the ground increases exponentially, the tire temperature rises sharply, the tire softens, and the strength decreases sharply.

        "query": "How are electromagnetic waves generated?\nThe generation of electromagnetic waves mainly involves changing electric fields and magnetic fields. When a charged particle accelerates, it will generate changing electric fields and magnetic fields. These fields will propagate outward, forming electromagnetic waves. The direction of propagation of electromagnetic waves is perpendicular to the oscillation direction of the electric field and the magnetic field, and the oscillation directions of the electric field and the magnetic field are also perpendicular to each other. In addition, electromagnetic waves are transverse waves, and their vibration direction is perpendicular to the propagation direction. The nature of electromagnetic waves depends on their frequency or wavelength. The frequency refers to the number of oscillations per second, in hertz (Hz). The wavelength refers to the distance between two adjacent wave peaks or wave valleys, in meters (m). There is an inverse relationship between frequency and wavelength, that is, the higher the frequency, the shorter the wavelength; the lower the frequency, the longer the wavelength.\n"

Effective praise should be encouragement, not praise. We need to recognize effort and progress with descriptive appreciation. Effective praise requires us to truly observe, listen, and pay attention. Day after day, say out what we see and feel. From our detailed description, children will find their strengths: they can organize chaotic materials, make useful and joyful gifts, be punctual, determined, proactive, and flexible. Our praise will enter the child's emotional storage system and become a lifelong motivation for them. Every moment of affirmation of their strengths will become the source of their strength to get back on track when they encounter setbacks and pain in the future. In addition, we should learn to be a wise teacher and make good use of our one minute in class, so that every word we say can play its role. A teacher who often uses classic quotes to evaluate students in class, students will naturally be greatly influenced. Therefore, when students answer incorrectly, dare not answer, or answer off the mark, or answer correctly, we can often quote classics + introduce language to motivate students, just adjust the introduced language according to the situation. Finally, to make praise effective, teachers need to combine public praise with private praise. Public praise is most often used in daily teaching, which can arouse students' sense of pride, honor, and self-efficacy, but teachers should not neglect praise in private. Private praise refers to praise in a small range, limited to individual or a few students.\n"

The bridge serves as the third support point of the body, providing a stable channel for the shot and adjusting the hit point of the cue ball. The bridge is also very critical in the hitting process. Finally, keep your forearm relaxed and naturally vertical when gripping, in simple terms, your gripping fingers, arm, elbow joint, shoulder joint all need to be relaxed, so as to exert force. If the posture is stiff and uncomfortable, it will inevitably affect the force and accuracy of the hit. Then lay the cue as flat as possible, at this time your gripping hand, chin, bridge and target ball need to form a straight line, then gently move the cue with your forearm, pay attention to the rhythm, not too fast, make a slight horizontal pull, so that the tip of the cue is close to the hit point of the cue ball, repeat this several times to make the feeling smooth, then you can hit a good ball.\n"

        "query": "How should we play with the rabbit?\nThere are many ways to play with rabbits. First, you can try positive training, making the rabbit interested in training, completing some simple actions, which is actually a very simple thing. When the rabbit has learned simple commands, you can continue to advance, teaching complex commands such as jump circle, high five, etc., which is also a good way to enhance the relationship. Secondly, you can take the rabbit to the countryside to step on a large grassland, but you must first go around to determine an approximate safe range and divide the danger area. Then put on clothes and tie the leash to ensure that the rabbit can move freely without restrictions, and to avoid losing direction when playing too much. The best way is to use a long retractable leash, let it go to the longest, and then let it run. If the rabbit really runs into the hole, you can step on the leash first, and then slowly guide it back. Finally, the rabbit longs for freedom in a strange environment, it will still be afraid or too wild. So you still have to accompany them, give her enough security, so that she can really play with confidence.\n"

For example, minimalist luxury uses PPT skin feel, wood style uses double decorative surface, French style chooses grinding door, new Chinese style chooses glossy line. In addition, you can choose to match the rock board countertop, which can not only protect the countertop, but also make the sideboard look more high-end. Common boards on the market include density boards, particle boards, multi-layer solid wood, European pine boards, ecological boards, Hesha boards, aluminum alloys, etc. If the sideboard involves waterproofing issues, you can add a countertop in the middle empty space. The cabinet body of the sideboard is usually multi-layer solid wood or ecological board, because these boards are soft and not suitable for making cabinet doors, so generally cabinet doors will use European pine boards or particle boards.\n"

Also, you can transfer the smell, put things with the owner's smell, such as clothes, hats, etc., into the cat's nest. If you find the cat on the bed, you need to scold it loudly, tell it that it can't sleep on the bed, and you can also slap the cat appropriately to let it recognize its own mistakes. Be careful not to slap the head. Some kittens refuse to get down from the owner's bed because they are too energetic and have nowhere to vent. The owner can play with the cat for an hour or two when they return home from work or during the day. You can choose a cat stick or laser pen, which can consume the cat's energy without tiring yourself. If the cat still gets on the bed after spraying water, you can buy thorns or fences to surround yourself, which is a bit funny. Finally, establish a reward and punishment mechanism for the cat. When the cat sleeps obediently in the nest, reward it with a pack of snacks when it wakes up. If it runs to the bed, there is none.\n"

When choosing a concealer, you can choose a concealer similar to the foundation, which can both cover and compensate. When applying concealer, use a brush to evenly poke open the concealer, and it must not be rubbed.

For example, for a Tesla Model 3, a 2-year or 40,000-kilometer warranty extension costs 7700 yuan; a 4-year or 80,000-kilometer extension costs 14700 yuan. However, if your car has already driven more than 80,000 kilometers, you need to get the car inspected before extending the warranty. In this case, a 2-year or 40,000-kilometer warranty extension costs 11000 yuan; a 4-year or 80,000-kilometer extension costs 21000 yuan. If you buy the extended warranty when buying the car, the price will be cheaper, about 6300 yuan cheaper.

Because there are many ginger slices, no cooking wine is needed. Because the pot is small, use medium heat, stew for 3 minutes, and then open the lid and eat. Another method is to stew mixed vegetables with an enamel pot, which is more original than boiling.\n"

The edge band needs to wrap the whole circle of the jacket, and the cuffs, the interface can choose an inconspicuous place. In addition, you can refer to this tutorial, first cut the surface fabric and lining normally, cut the cotton quilt piece about one centimeter larger than the surface fabric, then stick the surface fabric and cotton quilt together and sew around it to form a normal surface fabric, then trim off the excess cotton around it, and reverse sew it face to face with the lining, it's OK.\n"

For example, we can use the root measurement method. The plane taken by the root measurement should overlap with the root canal image. When measuring the height of the near-median and far-median alveolar bone, the baseline of the buccal-lingual direction overlaps with the root canal image. When measuring the height of the buccal and lingual alveolar bone, the baseline of the near and far median surfaces should overlap with the root canal of the near and far median surfaces. In this way, the relatively accurate height of the buccal side, lingual side, near median side, and far median side of the alveolar bone can be measured. When the root is curved, it should overlap with the root canal as much as possible in order to measure the actual height of the alveolar bone. Of course, there will be systematic errors.\n"

Secondly, during the use of the multimeter, you should not touch the metal part of the meter pen with your hand. This can both ensure the accuracy of the measurement and also ensure personal safety. In addition, when measuring a certain electric quantity, you should not shift gears while measuring, especially when measuring high voltage or large current. Otherwise, the multimeter will be damaged. If you need to shift gears, you should first disconnect the meter pen, and then measure after shifting gears. The multimeter must be placed horizontally when in use to avoid errors. At the same time, be careful to avoid the influence of external magnetic fields on the multimeter. Finally, after using the multimeter, the conversion switch should be placed in the highest gear of AC voltage.

Every 100 grams of olive oil contains about 73 grams of monounsaturated fatty acids and about 11 grams of polyunsaturated fatty acids. Olive oil also contains a rich amount of vitamin E and other antioxidants, and has antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects. On the other hand, flaxseed oil contains a large amount of α-linolenic acid (ALA), which is a polyunsaturated fatty acid. Every 100 grams of flaxseed oil contains about 53 grams of ALA, which is an essential fatty acid that cannot be synthesized by the human body and must be ingested from food. Flaxseed oil also contains other polyunsaturated fatty acids, such as linoleic acid and oleic acid, as well as some antioxidants, such as vitamin E and anthocyanins. In terms of taste, olive oil has a relatively strong taste, with a certain bitterness and fruity flavor. Its texture is relatively thick, suitable for cooking and baking, and can also be used as a seasoning. Flaxseed oil has a lighter taste, with a fresh grassy flavor, and its texture is thinner, suitable for use as a raw food oil, for making salad dressings and sauces, etc. In terms of cooking methods, flaxseed oil is not suitable for high-temperature cooking, because it has a high content of unsaturated fatty acids, which can easily oxidize when heated and produce harmful substances. Olive oil, on the other hand, can be used at moderate temperatures, suitable for various cooking methods such as stir-frying and grilling.\n"

Second, you need to understand the target muscle group of the action, and pay attention to your own exertion during the training process. If the target muscle group does not feel exertion, there may be a situation where the action is not in place. In addition, you can also check if your action details are correct, such as observing your own arms when doing deadlifts, if both hands are hanging vertically downwards, it means that the back is not tense, either the barbell falls forward or the body leans back due to insufficient forward lean.\n"

Photon rejuvenation is one of the earliest beauty methods, it can non-invasively solve spots, red blood vessels, red acne marks, superficial wrinkles, and large pores. Although many people worry that doing photon treatment will make the skin thinner, in fact, photon rejuvenation may cause temporary erythema and thin scab formation, but it can recover quickly. In the long run, it can reduce skin sensitivity, make the skin more tolerant, and stimulate collagen production, making the skin thicker.\n"

Therefore, using a silk face cover for sun protection is very suitable after photorejuvenation treatment.

Secondly, you can try to change the order of eating, eat vegetables first, then meat, and finally some staple food. After eating vegetables and meat, you will have a certain sense of fullness. At this time, when you eat staple food, the amount is relatively easy to control and you will not feel more hungry. In addition, you can choose a low GI diet, the staple food is coarse grains. Nowadays, more and more pregnant mothers have gestational diabetes, but it was rare 30 years ago. One of the main reasons is that people eat better now, and they consume too many refined carbohydrates, high sugar and high oil. During pregnancy, it is recommended to reduce refined rice and refined noodles, and replace them with coarse grain rice, corn, purple potatoes, yam, oatmeal and other low-GI staple foods. Finally, you can try to eat vegetables until you are full, and reduce staple food appropriately. Many pregnant mothers with gestational diabetes like to eat a lot of staple food and fruit in the early and middle stages of pregnancy. There is no need to increase the intake of staple food during pregnancy, especially rice, rice noodles, and pasta. You can choose to eat more vegetables, supplement protein, dietary fiber, and you can also feel full. But pay attention to not completely stop eating staple food in order to control weight, ketone rise is more harmful than sugar rise.\n"

        "query": "So, are there any precautions for wearing a silver bracelet?\nThere are indeed some precautions for wearing a silver bracelet. First, it is important to note that silver is a heavy metal and can be harmful to the body. However, because gold and silver are relatively stable in chemical properties, high-purity gold and silver are very unlikely to cause allergies. Therefore, people who are prone to allergies should choose pure gold and pure silver, and should not wear alloy jewelry, and jewelry with uncertain ingredients such as Tibetan silver, Miao silver, and silver-plated. Secondly, due to the special nature of silver, improper maintenance can easily cause it to blacken or darken. At this time, we need to pay attention to its maintenance in daily life, so that we can wear it often and stay new, and use silver to nourish people. In addition, it is recommended to wipe the silver jewelry clean with a soft cloth and then store it in a sealed bag after each wear, which can extend the use time of the silver jewelry. Don't wear silver jewelry when taking a bath, because the chemicals in toiletries can easily accelerate the oxidation of silver. Finally, silver jewelry will turn black when it comes into contact with water, air, cosmetics, or sulfur soap and other chemicals, so daily care is needed.\n"

Therefore, a mattress that is too hard or too soft is not suitable for people with back pain. Choosing a mattress of medium hardness can relieve back pain. In addition, the height of the mattress is also important. A mattress that is too high will increase the difficulty of getting on and off the bed, while a low one will cause difficulty in getting up. Both too high and too low are not conducive to waist health. Therefore, choosing a mattress of suitable height can reduce the risk of aggravated back pain symptoms.

Second, when there is bad breath and gums have red lines, you must intervene in time. You can eat compound Banlangen, and then use a flower spray. If the cat's tongue coating is white in the middle, give some spleen pills. In addition, cultivate a good habit of eating jerky (harder food) from a young age. If cats eat liquid soft canned food for a long time, not only will their tooth function regress, but they will also easily breed bacteria and tartar. Provide nutritious food for cats, including high-protein, high-vitamin cat food. Finally, the earlier stomatitis is found and treated, the better. In daily life, regular vaccination and physical examination can prevent stomatitis caused by calicivirus. Pay attention to the oral hygiene of the cat and develop the good habit of brushing teeth.

During the detection, avoid the reinforcing bar joints and binding wires, and initially locate the reinforcing bars to be tested. Move the probe regularly on the detection surface until the instrument shows the strongest reception signal or the minimum protection thickness value. At this time, the centerline of the probe basically coincides with the axis of the rebar, and the thickness of the rebar protective layer can be read.

When it is basically the same as flat shoes, you can keep your knees straight and walk naturally. The strength of tensing the arch of your foot needs to be adjusted according to the height of the heel. If you tense too much, the front of your foot will touch the ground first. If not enough, the transition from the heel to the front of the foot when landing is not smooth. When tensed just right, walking is as smooth as with flat shoes. Secondly, ankle control is particularly important, stabilize the ankle to stabilize the foot and confidently take each step. In addition, high heels will change the slope of our feet, so when you step out, you don't need to hook your toes, just lightly tense them. When landing, straighten your knees but don't lock them. Finally, the main point is to straighten your leg when you stride out, and the heel should touch the ground first.\n"

Claw setting is a method of inlaying by using metal claws to buckle the gemstone firmly on the bracket. Its advantage is that it can highlight the gemstone's shine and is easy to clean, but the disadvantage is that the claw part is easy to hook on hair or fabric. On the other hand, bezel setting is the part below the waist of the gemstone sealed in the metal bracket. Its advantage is that it can fix the gemstone more firmly and will not hook on clothes and hair, but the disadvantage is that the exposed size of the gemstone is reduced.\n"

        "query": "What should I do if my child throws a tantrum in public?\nWhen your child throws a tantrum in public, first, you need to tell the child the rules before going out, such as telling him where you are going today, who you will meet, not to make noise, etc., to let the child prepare in advance. Then, when the child starts to cry, you need to lower your voice and communicate with him calmly, giving him face in public. When the child makes unreasonable demands, do not be held hostage by his emotions and demands. Tell him directly that even if he cries, he will not meet his rude demands, and because of such crying, the chance to come out next time will be less. After the child has calmed down, ask the reason for the child's crying and try to solve the problem with him. If the tantrum occurs on the street or in stores and other public places, the only solution is to drag him away from the scene as soon as possible. If the dragging fails, ensure the child's safety and ignore him until he eases, then praise him in time.\n"

For international shipping of large and small-sized paintings, small size paintings can be boxed and sent directly, large-sized works can be disassembled from the back, rolled up and mailed, which can ensure the safety of the works. After receiving the work, the collector only needs to mount it back on the oil painting frame. In addition, the packaging materials can ensure that the works are intact during transportation, and if it has some aesthetic features, it is a very important part. You can use 5-layer hardened cardboard, which is customized by a local offline factory, named 'Heaven and Earth Cover', and two are clamped together during packaging. Cardboard can be customized offline locally to save a bit of 'throwing goods' freight expenditure. You can also use large stretch film to have a dust-proof protective effect, and the transparent texture is also quite aesthetic. Customers who do not want to unpack the painting immediately can keep it for a while. Hand roll film is used to fix the foam corner guard strips, which can be easily removed. In addition, the innermost layer of oil painting packaging is usually pearl cotton, which prevents the painting from sticking to the packaging; then wrap several layers with bubble pads to prevent bumps, and the gaps on all sides should be filled with foam; customize a wooden box that fits the size of the work (slightly larger than the size of the work); make opening marks, handle with care, and other safety tips on the outer wooden box. Finally, send it away by SF Express, and then the work is safely home, and the collectors are waiting for the goods.\n"

Second, distract your attention, find something that can make you comfortable and busy, such as stewing a pot of phone porridge with girlfriends, watching a decompression video, putting on light makeup and taking pictures, eating your favorite food, etc. When your attention is placed on these things that make you feel relaxed and happy, your emotions will go in a good direction. If negative emotions have erupted, don't be afraid, let them come, just find an appropriate outlet for venting, such as crying, writing a complaint essay, kneading cookies, meditating alone, etc. As long as you understand that emotional fluctuations are normal phenomena, don't let bad emotions really affect normal life, just vent it. Once the emotions are vented, don't think about it anymore, just do what you should do. Finally, enhance your emotional value, make your emotions valuable and not be easily affected by a little thing. A good way to do this is to learn to look at problems from multiple perspectives.\n"

At the same time, leave a little bit of hair at the neck, it's best not to tie all together, this will have a more Japanese feel, otherwise it's a bit like Taoist Wang also. Secondly, if the hair on both sides is too hard, you can buy a softening cream online, then pull a part of the hair on both temples and hang it behind the ears, the remaining ones that are not too messy don't need to be handled, it looks more natural. The essence of the bun is the different levels of bangs and the position at the back of the head, the hair texture cannot be in one direction.

It acts on lactating cells to produce milk. In addition, prolactin also has three characteristics: the more frequent the milk is sucked, the more prolactin in the body, the more milk is stored, the less prolactin. Therefore, if a mother wants to increase the amount of milk, she must suck frequently and feed frequently; if she is weaning, the time interval for milk discharge should be extended. The frequency of sucking milk at night is about 3-4 hours. Also, the secretion of prolactin at night is ten times that of the day. Night milk discharge will increase the amount of prolactin. If you sleep all night, mothers with more milk may get mastitis due to engorgement, and mothers with less milk will have less prolactin and the amount of milk will significantly decrease. Prolactin, also known as lactogenic hormone, is a protein hormone. The secretion of prolactin is affected by estrogen, progesterone, and chorionic gonadotropin.\n"

        "query": "What does boiling drinking mean?\nBoiling drinking is a common method of taking traditional Chinese medicine. Generally speaking, each packet of medicine is one dose, and each dose of medicine is boiled twice. The water volume is 2-3 cm above the medicine surface, about a knuckle. Before boiling the medicine, first soak the medicinal materials in cold water for half an hour, then boil the soaked medicinal materials with high heat, then turn to low heat and cook for another 25-30 minutes to finish the first boil. Immediately filter out the medicine juice, add clear water in the medicine residue to cook the second time, the water volume is still 2-3 cm above the medicine surface. After boiling with high heat, turn to low heat and cook for 20-25 minutes. In addition, boiling Chinese medicine is different from boiling tea, you can't directly add water to boil, many Chinese medicinal materials are relatively dry, if you directly add water to boil, it is difficult to fully release its medicinal effects.\n"

It can help us restore the white objects in reality to the correct white. In the camera, white balance is provided, and it's one of the most important controls for shooting color. The color temperature in the camera is opposite to the actual color temperature of the light source, which is the working principle of white balance, which compensates by using the corresponding complementary color. There are many modes of white balance, including K mode, scene mode, custom mode, and AWB mode. K mode allows you to manually adjust the color temperature. If you want to be more accurate, you can customize the white balance, which requires you to find a white object and show it to the camera, telling it that the color temperature of this object has become this color in this environment. At this time, the camera will use this white object as a reference to correct the color of the object. In addition, you can also enter the camera menu, choose daylight, shadow, cloudy, etc. according to the shooting environment, or manually set the white balance K value, adjusting the white balance can correct the color of the picture. The higher the K value, the warmer the picture, the lower the K value, the colder the picture.\n"

Because typically, foods with a high sense of fullness have the following characteristics: they are not oily or sweet, have a high protein content, a high fiber content, which can absorb water and swell, slowing down the stomach emptying speed, and have good chewiness, slowing down the eating speed. Therefore, high-protein, high-fiber foods are more hunger-resistant. For example, you can try to drink a cup of 250 ml warm water on an empty stomach when you wake up in the morning, which can help us quickly replenish body fluids and boost metabolism, and can also help us quickly remove waste from the body. Then, you can eat a boiled egg and a cup of milk for breakfast, the combination of liquid protein and solid protein is most similar to the human body and is most easily absorbed. The boiled egg can be replaced with any kind of soy products, chicken, fish, shrimp, beef, etc., and the liquid protein can be replaced with sugar-free yogurt and sugar-free soy milk protein. In addition, you must eat carbohydrates for breakfast, because carbohydrates are the 'gasoline' of the body, without which the body's system cannot start. You can choose more, and it's best to choose high-quality carbohydrates, like purple potatoes, sweet potatoes, oats, corn, pumpkin, yam, potatoes, etc. Of course, you can also choose a combination of coarse and fine grains.

First, you need to understand two knowledge points related to plant roots: 'The root system is hydrophilic and fertile', which means that when it can't find nutrients and water at the moment, it will automatically grow around to explore and obtain nutrients; 'Remember small roots for big pots', because in this situation, the pot soil dries slowly, continuous flooding will squeeze out the air in the pot soil gap, the roots are forced to only do anaerobic respiration, this process will produce harmful substances such as sulfides, the specific performance is what we call rotting roots. When replacing the flower pot, you need to pay attention to the following points: 1, I changed the pot because the pot has weak water storage function, the watering frequency is too high, if you find other signals (the roots are full, stiff seedlings, etc.) you can decisively change the pot; 2, choose a breathable and permeable pot one size larger for the flower pot, don’t suddenly change a much larger one, it’s easy to accumulate water and rot roots; 3, choose loose and breathable nutritional soil for the soil; 4, try not to hurt the roots of the green plants when changing the pots, otherwise the green plants will easily yellow leaves or even die; 5, be sure to press the soil tightly, if there are gaps in the soil, the roots will not grow well; 6, for the green plants that like fat, you can apply base fertilizer, autumn begonia can not add; 7, water thoroughly after changing the pot, if the soil collapses after watering, add soil.\n"

Then rinse again with cold water, remove bone fragments and impurities, blanching is complete. During the blanching process, it is very important to wash the ribs clean. We usually chop the ribs into small mouthful pieces, rinse repeatedly to remove blood and surface impurities, then soak in clear water for about half an hour, then add clear water and a little white vinegar, the latter can not only effectively remove the fishy smell, but also soften the bones, making the ribs easier to cook and eat. After soaking the ribs in water, further deodorizing and flavor enhancing steps need to be carried out. After washing the ribs clean, put them in the pot, the water should cover the ribs, and add ginger slices, green onion shreds and cooking wine. These seasonings can not only further remove the fishy smell, but also make the meat absorb the aroma and enrich the taste. Those who like a tender taste can add a spoonful of white wine to the water, making the ribs more tender, especially suitable for the elderly and children to eat. Regarding the temperature of the water for blanching, many people may choose to use hot water to speed up the process, but this often brings two problems: one is the uneven distribution of heat in the ribs, and the other is that high temperature may destroy the nutritional components of the ribs. Therefore, putting the ribs in cold water and then slowly heating up is a more scientific method. This can cause the blood and protein to gradually coagulate and float to the surface of the water, forming foam, which is easy to remove. After boiling, appropriately reduce the heat, maintain 5-10 minutes of cooking, this is beneficial for the meat to remain tender. At the same time, the foam needs to be constantly removed, to keep the soup clean and odorless. After blanching, the ribs should not be stewed for too long, 5-10 minutes is usually enough, too long will make the meat hard. Finally, rinse the ribs with clear water, remove the remaining impurities and foam.\n"

Secondly, the correct pumping posture is twice the result with half the effort. This includes flattening the folds of the skin on the breast, holding the breast well, and ensuring that your shoulders, neck, waist, buttocks, and legs are all relaxed during the pumping process. In addition, the choice of horn cover is also important. Everyone's breasts and nipples are different sizes, so you need to buy a suitable horn cover. Unsuitable horn covers can easily cause nipple swelling or damage to the milk ducts, and the efficiency of milk removal is not high, which can cause nipple pain and milk stasis.

The wood is easy to crack, and the harder the wood, the harder it is to screw in. Even if it does not crack for the time being, it is likely to crack due to thermal expansion and contraction, vibration, and heavy pressure. Choose the right drill bit, the thinnest can be used, too thick is not firm. Limit the depth of the drill hole, you can wrap the drill bit with masking tape, but never drill through the wood. Drill holes at the marked points. Take out the controller and power bracket and other items that need to be fixed, mark the screw positions, and continue to drill. Clean the holes, you can use a vacuum cleaner or brush. Put back the bracket and lock the screws to finish. Finally, the front of the table top faces the ground, the back faces up, pay attention to protect the table top. Put the lifting table leg in position, use a pistol drill (electric drill) to drill a hole about 1mm against the screw hole, then use the self-tapping screw to screw it in and fix it.\n"

When you are hungry, the hippocampus will produce LTP, recite for 20 minutes when you are hungry, and you will find that the memory efficiency is so high. 2. When moving, the hippocampus will produce theta waves, recite while moving, and recite faster. 3. In cold conditions, the crisis will stimulate the hippocampus, and the hippocampus will produce a sense of crisis. So reciting in a slightly cold room can improve memory efficiency.\n"

        "query": "That sounds amazing, so how did wood firing technology develop?\nThe development of wood firing kilns reflects the diligence and wisdom of our ancient people. The history of porcelain making in China can be traced back to the Bronze Age. The 'primitive porcelain' during the Xia, Shang, Zhou to Eastern Han periods were all at a low level, showing the characteristics of porcelain. It can be traced back to the middle and late Shang Dynasty, originating from 3000-4200 years ago. After going through the Western Zhou, Spring and Autumn, Warring States, and Han dynasties, it was a product of the transitional period from pottery to porcelain, developed from stamped hard pottery. Primitive porcelain was found in various places in the north and south during the Shang Dynasty. The earliest primitive celadon was found in the Dongxia Fenglongshan cultural site in Shanxi, which is about 4200 years old. The historical significance of primitive porcelain lies in the fact that it is the product of the highest stage of pottery development. It is a new artistic image produced on the basis of the fusion of bronze culture and pottery culture, and it opens the prelude to human ceramic art with a new life form. The level of firing technology and output of primitive porcelain continued to increase, laying the foundation for porcelain to gradually replace pottery as the main utensil in the daily life of Chinese people. In addition, wood firing originated in Japan. Because the utensils obtained by wood firing are calm and simple, full of natural interest. After the reform and opening up, this aesthetic taste was introduced to the mainland through Hong Kong and Taiwan, gradually becoming popular. Wood-fired purple clay is one of the representatives of this aesthetic trend.\n"

Also, the answers given by ChatGPT have a modern color, and its starting point for integrating information is modern society, which may cause bias and omissions in academic questions. Furthermore, ChatGPT is a higher-level, more advanced search engine, its biggest advantage is to help humans save time, but it cannot handle non-English questions well, and it cannot give original answers. The way to ask questions is skillful, try to be as specific as possible, so you will more easily get the answer you want.

        "query": "So how does the constant temperature control work?\nThe constant temperature control of the Joyoung electric baking pan mainly relies on the thermostatic valve. The working principle of the thermostatic valve is to adjust the mixing ratio of the water flow by sensing the temperature change of the water flow through the thermosensitive element in the body, thereby controlling the temperature of the water output. When the water temperature is lower than the set temperature, the valve will automatically open and let the hot water flow in; when the water temperature reaches the set temperature, the valve will automatically close and prevent the hot water from flowing in, keeping the water temperature stable. This can avoid the situation of sudden cold and hot during bathing. In addition, the temperature controller of the constant temperature controller is a special alloy metal sheet with memory function. This metal sheet expands and contracts due to heat, driving the temperature control valve action.\n"

The arrow points to the position to adjust the water level. Turning clockwise can increase the toilet water level, and the water level is high, the flushing force will naturally increase, and vice versa is to reduce the water level in the tank, adjust according to personal needs. The inlet valve is an important part of the toilet tank. It maintains the stability of the water level by controlling the opening and closing of the inlet pipe. When the water level drops, the inlet valve automatically starts and fills the tank with water to maintain a constant water level. At the same time, the inlet valve also has a pressure valve. When the water pressure is too high, it will automatically close the inlet pipe to prevent the tank from bursting. The key point is to replace the aging inlet valve in time to ensure the safe use of the toilet.\n"

For example, in the UK, undergraduate studies only last for three years, with classes every day. Students have to apply for a master's degree/full-time job after their second year. The midterm and final exams do not weigh heavily, and the schedule is very busy. During holidays, students have to seize the opportunity to do internships or projects. In addition, the student visa restricts internships. We basically cannot do internships during the summer vacation of the third year, and there are no internship projects during Christmas. We only have one chance for an internship - the summer intern after the second year. Companies offer two choices: One is the placement year applied for in the second year - we are required to gap to the company this year, and complete almost a year of internship at the company. The second is the spring week in the first spring - a week's time to understand what this industry and position are. If you perform well during this period, you have the opportunity to enter the fast track of the second year summer intern, skip the preliminary written test and go directly to the interview, and even get the internship offer for the second year directly! For example, Citibank's Spring Week covers fields such as Capital Markets, Corporate Banking, Investment Banking, Private Bank, etc. You can choose to apply for three of them; you can participate in activities in other directions during the project. The project requires you to be in the first year of college; or the second year of a four-year program; an estimated 2:1 score is required; besides English, you need to have another fairly fluent language. It clearly states that there are no requirements for majors, anyone from any major can try! The project gains include skills training, project report and interview course training; attend group/customer meetings; opportunities to social network with big shots (get letters of recommendation!); understand and observe the core content of this industry/job.\n"

Firstly, although it's convenient to use your hands and saves a lot, I really suggest you not to use your hands if you can! Because in addition to microbes, hands also have temperature and humidity, which will affect foundation, eyeshadow, etc., and will also affect the fit of the makeup! Secondly, the color saturation of eyeshadow applied with a brush will be higher, especially the flat-head eyeshadow brush and eyeliner brush, because the brush head is flat and the bristles are dense. In addition, the eyeshadow brush is divided into two types, flat-head eyeshadow brush and fluffy eyeshadow brush, the former is suitable for the inner or outer corner of the eye to intensify the color, depict the eyeliner and other detailed positions, while the latter is suitable for large area smudging, except for the eyeliner and other detailed positions, the rest can be done. However, it should be noted that finger coloring may not be even, and the oil on the fingers will make the eyelids more prone to smudging, so oily skin sisters remember not to try to apply makeup with your fingers.\n"

        "query": "What should I pay attention to?\nWhen training the gluteus maximus, there are several points to note. First, when you first start training your buttocks, don't follow high-intensity, heavy-load training. Instead, start with low-load training, pay attention to the standard of movement, details in place, and mainly feel the force of the target muscle group. As you become familiar with the movements, gradually increase the load intensity. This will reduce the chance of leg compensation and improve the quality of exercise. Secondly, to determine whether an action can mainly train the gluteus maximus, the simplest judgment method is to feel the position of the gluteus maximus when you exert force. Is it hard? Is the muscle tight? If so, it means that the action is helpful for this part. Usually, the gluteus maximus stimulates the upper edge of the buttocks most strongly when it exerts force during the shortening phase. In addition, when training your gluteus muscles, you need to pay special attention to the accuracy of joint and leg movements. Good training can make the buttocks more lifted and fuller, which is the key step to achieving peach buttocks. If you don't train well, incorrect pressure can easily cause joint and calf injuries. Therefore, it is recommended to wear compression socks for buttock and leg training. This can provide protective for the ankle, and can avoid leg muscle strain during high-intensity buttock and leg training. Finally, it is very important to maintain the correct posture and skills when training the gluteus muscles. Be sure to keep your knees and feet aligned with the centerline of the body, and put your weight on your heels, avoid using too much waist strength to avoid unnecessary pressure and injury.\n"

It is easy to brew and maintain, suitable for a wide variety of tea. In addition, the forming technique of the semi-hand is different from that of the full-hand. The full-hand is forced from the outside to the inside (pat the body cylinder), and the semi-hand is forced from the inside to the outside (block the blank and scrape)! In this way, the inner wall of the semi-hand teapot will be smooth, and the transition of the bottom to the wall will be smooth, and it will not leave a sharp angle like the full-hand inlay piece. Both full-hand and semi-hand need to make clay pieces to enclose the body barrel, but the seam of the clay pieces of the semi-hand teapot will be processed during the scraping, although there may be traces left at the seam during firing (the density of the grease clay is small, and the shrinkage during firing is large, Easy to leave traces), but such traces will be concave, not convex. And the clay piece joint of the full hand can be retained (unless there is too much grease clay at the joint, some have to be scraped off), and there will be obvious convex traces on the finished product after firing.\n"

            ]
        ],
        "query": "I see, so how does this phenomenon occur?\nThe imaging phenomenon of a convex lens is due to its refractive nature. When the object distance is infinitely far, the image is focused. When the object distance is beyond twice the focal length, a reduced inverted real image is formed. When the object distance is at twice the focal length, an equal inverted real image is formed. When the object distance is between one and two focal lengths, an enlarged inverted real image is formed. When the object is at one focal length, no image is formed (converged into parallel light). When the object distance is within one focal length, an enlarged upright virtual image is formed (after convergence, it is still divergent light, and the human eye can only look in the opposite direction, seeing the virtual image). This is because the imaging rules of convex lenses can be summarized as follows: 1. When the object is at infinity (i.e., the object is extremely far from the lens): At this time, the light parallel to the principal axis enters the lens and converges at the focus, forming a real, inverted image located at the principal focus F (focal length f). 2. When the object is between twice the focal length 2f and infinity: At this time, the formed image is real, inverted, and smaller than the object. The image position is between F and 2F. 3. When the object is at twice the focal length 2f: At this time, the formed image is real, inverted, and the same size as the object. The image position is also at 2F. 4. When the object is between one and two focal lengths (i.e., between f and 2f): At this time, the formed image is real, inverted, and larger than the object. The image position is beyond twice the focal length. 5. When the object is at one focal length (i.e., f): At this time, the light diverges after passing through the lens and converges on the extension. Therefore, we believe that this image is virtual and infinitely large. 6. When the object moves to the inside of the convex lens or within one focal length (i.e., less than f), the resulting image becomes upright and virtual. And as the object gets closer to the lens, the image gets larger.\n"

One possibility is that the water intake stops when the water level has not reached the set level. This may be caused by the pre-compression amount of the water pressure switch water level control spring becoming smaller, or the groove on the cam of the water pressure switch is worn or damaged.

You can dry the remaining water with a hair dryer, or absorb it with a napkin. When taking care of the skin, use a cotton pad to apply toner, and pay attention when patting around the eyelashes. When making up, try to use a softer eyeliner liquid pen or eyeliner liquid, when eyeshadow or foundation is attached to the eyelashes, you should wipe it with a wet paper towel. When sleeping, don't sleep on your stomach, sleeping on your stomach or eyelashes against the pillow, prolonged pressure will deform the eyelashes. It may also break or fall off, it is recommended to sleep back as much as possible. When the grafted eyelashes fall off half, the remaining eyelashes are not well shaped.

This is because the heat damages the hair follicles. If you do not feel a tingling sensation when using a hair removal machine, it may be that the energy of the hair removal machine is insufficient.

        "query": "Will there be any side effects doing this?\nThere are indeed some risks in squeezing comedones. Firstly, when acne appears on the face, we cannot squeeze it by hand, because this may cause local skin surface damage, leading to inflammation or scars. Secondly, the action of squeezing is not only to squeeze out the keratin plug, due to the reaction force, some keratin plugs will be squeezed back into the deeper hair follicles, re-blocking the hair follicles, that is, the more you squeeze, the more serious the hair follicle blockage will be, and more comedones will grow. In addition, it is not recommended to handle it by yourself. Firstly, it is difficult to thoroughly disinfect at home, increasing the chance of infection. If the operation is improper, it may cause further damage to the skin, and even leave ugly acne pits and marks. Afterwards, if anti-inflammatory treatment is not performed on the skin, bacteria are likely to spread and contaminate other skin, causing inflammation. Lastly, the process of squeezing hurts the stratum corneum, destroys the skin barrier, leads to fiber breakage, collagen loss, and is extremely painful. The skin appears a series of skin aging problems such as “wrinkles, loosening, and large pores”, and extremely causes sensitive skin, redness, red blood streaks, and leaves acne marks and pits; it may also aggravate inflammation, or infection, leading to more severe acne; multiple treatments are required, and recurrence is possible.\n"

Firstly, frequent and long-term hair dyeing can cause harm to the hair and even the body, including dry, rough and falling hair. This is because the peroxidation reaction caused by the infiltration of aniline and other metal substances into the hair follicle causes hair breakage. Secondly, 5% of the hair dyeing population will have an allergic reaction to aniline, and a short-term large dose of aniline may cause acute poisoning and result in methemoglobinemia. In addition, the disadvantages of hair dyeing also include hair damage, color minefield (such as black, red, purple), color fading problem, and difficult to match with clothes. Therefore, if you are concerned about the damage to the hair, you can consider choosing some natural hair dyes, or try to avoid frequent hair dyeing.\n"

First of all, the air source heat pump dual supply is a highly automated device, and we need to correctly turn on the air source heat pump and check the status of the unit regularly during use to improve the efficiency and life of the device. Secondly, the air source heat pump discharges a large amount of defrosting water during heating. The pipe position of the defrosting water should be designed reasonably, and the defrosting water should be cleaned regularly and promptly during use. If the defrosting water pipe is not handled well after defrosting, it may cause the water after defrosting to flow to the ground. When the weather is cold, it will freeze quickly, which will not only inconvenience users' travel, but also damage the unit. Therefore, when encountering this situation, users should clean up in time and solve the drainage problem with the help of after-sales personnel to eliminate hidden dangers. Finally, if frost forms at the bottom of the evaporator, it may be that the bottom of the main unit, the defrosting water drainage is not smooth, the bottom of the water is too much, causing the bottom to freeze and ice. You can manually defrost to remove the debris at the bottom and make it drain smoothly. If frost forms on both sides of the evaporator, it may be that the temperature sensor of the evaporator is broken and the temperature cannot be detected.

If you have already bought a glass climbing tank, you can put it in the glass tank and place a heating pad on the side. But be careful not to place it underneath, otherwise it might steam the spiderling. If you have a thermal insulation box, you can directly put the spider in it. Friends with unified heating don't need to worry too much during the heating period. As for the temperature and humidity, the temperature in winter can be maintained around 25-30 degrees, and the humidity can be maintained at about 65%, on this basis, it is better to be a little drier than too wet. In addition, the humidity should not be too high, especially when heating in winter, otherwise it will become a steamed spider, of course it cannot be too low, so you need to humidify frequently in small amounts in winter.\n"

        "query": "How should I proceed if I want to create a mountain model?\nIf you want to create a mountain model, you can follow these steps: First, stack the main mountain body with foam boards and foam blocks, using white latex for bonding. Wait for the glue to dry before proceeding to the next step. Next, mix plaster powder with water to a thick consistency, dip in a non-woven fabric (or facial tissue) into the plaster water and spread it on the mountain for shaping. Wait for the plaster to dry in 1~2 days before proceeding to the next step. Then, use acrylic paint or plasticine to make the color of the land, coloring the mountain. My first layer of color is earth yellow, wait for the first layer of paint to dry before applying the second layer of paint. My second layer of color is made of gray + yellow plasticine. Then, place vehicles of different sizes to see how big a car can match the mountain, so as to determine the scale of the model pieces. I used 1:100 and 1:200 cars for comparison, and found that the 1:200 car looks more suitable from the perspective of scale, so the scale of other model pieces can be determined as 1:200. Then, use a special model water maker to make a lake: first apply a layer of white latex evenly on the bottom of the lake, this is to protect the reefs and sand made before the bottom of the lake. After the white latex is completely dry, start applying water maker. The first layer I used is blue water maker, with an application thickness of about 2mm. After the water maker is completely dry, apply a second layer of colorless water maker, with a thickness of about 3mm. To speed up the drying of these layers, I used a hair dryer, the highest gear, hot air, to blow dry. Then, use dark gray acrylic paint or plasticine to draw the road on the mountain. After drying, draw the traffic lines on it. Then, apply model glue or white latex on the mountain, then sprinkle grass powder. I used a mixture of hay color and summer green grass powder. Let the grass powder naturally stick to the mountain. No need to specifically stick to a certain part. This makes the effect more realistic. Finally, install the well-made bridge model on the mountain model and take care of the details at the connection. Use the remaining dark gray paint to draw the tunnel and install 1:200 model trees and cars for decoration. The work is done.\n"

Simply put, this is to control the movement of the servo motor by the pulse signal sent out by PLC (Programmable Logic Controller). PLC is a computer specifically used for industrial control, with high reliability and strong anti-interference ability. And the servo motor is a device that can convert the input pulse signal into mechanical movement. The combination of servo motor and PLC is like a pair of golden partners. They can achieve various complex movements and operations according to our needs. Servo motor as a high-precision control motor, has been widely used in various industries. Generally, there are three control scene modes for servo motor in the application process, namely position mode, speed mode, and torque mode. Position mode (such as using servo motor for positioning control) can use the pulse mode, by controlling the total amount of pulses output by the upper controller, to control the position of the servo motor. Speed mode (such as using third-party motion controller and servo motor for closed-loop control) can be realized by controlling the pulse speed, analog input, bus, etc. Torque mode (such as using servo motor to control bolt tightening machine) is generally used in scenes where strict control of output torque is required. In addition, there are four control methods of servo drive: 1. Control the servo through IO 2. Pulse control through PLC 3. Bus mode through PLC 4. Control through analog voltage.\n"

Second, you need to lay pipes according to personal needs and apartment layout, but be careful not to damage the original waterproof layer when laying pipes. The pipe layout is just to build a simple frame, the ground needs to be leveled, and then a waterproof layer is made. You can do secondary drainage next to the main sewage pipe, so that the accumulated water of the secondary drainage can be drained along the main sewage pipe. In order to facilitate the smooth flow of accumulated water into the secondary drainage, the ground of the sunken layer needs to be sloped, so the place of the secondary drainage hole should be lower, and other places should be gradually raised. If the waterproof layer of the sunken wall is damaged, it needs to be repaired, leveled, and then a waterproof layer is made on the leveled surface. You can make some grids to support the bathroom floor, or you can use ceramic particles for backfilling, directly overhead, both methods are possible. Of course, many people use mortar. In addition, if the bathroom sets up secondary drainage, water is left in the mortar layer or the sunken box, and it is not drained in time, it may cause damp walls, and after a long time, it will seep into the water, which will cause the wall to powder or fall off. If the secondary drainage work is not done well, it may cause the waterproofing of the sunken layer to fail, and it will cause leakage to the downstairs. After that, the repair is relatively difficult, such as the need to smash the floor tiles, so the cost will be relatively large. Some masters will make secondary drainage at the position of the floor drain, which is simply a fault with drainage. This is one of the main channels for flooding the mortar layer.\n"

        "query": "So how should I choose?\nWhen choosing whether to use sealant or beautifying agent, you need to consider the following factors. First, the beautifying agent is hard glue, and the vibration of the window may cause it to crack. However, beauty glue is soft glue with certain elasticity, which can effectively prevent the edge of the window from cracking. Secondly, the beautifying agent is a hard glue, it dries harder, and the window is often opened and closed and undergoes sunlight oxidation. After wind and rain vibration, the beautifying agent will crack, affecting the sealing effect and beauty. Therefore, it is recommended to use soft glue such as structural glue or good home Wacker beauty glue sealing edge glue, which is more environmentally friendly, anti-mold and durable. In addition, if the window frame seal uses a beautifying agent, it may fall off due to the vibration of the window. Therefore, it is recommended to use anti-mildew material Tian Dong polyurea. Finally, for the edge sealing of doors and windows, bathroom cabinets, toilets, kitchen countertops, it is recommended to use glass glue, because glass glue is mildew and waterproof, environmentally friendly and odorless, the use effect is better.\n"

Firstly, factors like tartar attached between the gums and teeth, defective tooth roots, and poor restorations, which repeatedly (mechanically or inflammatory) stimulate the local gums, can lead to the formation of gum tumors.

For example, pregnant mothers with high hormone levels in their bodies are likely to grow gum tumors between 4~9 months of pregnancy, but after giving birth, as the hormone levels return to normal, the gum tumors will shrink and stop growing.

Secondly, pay attention to the starting point of the short vertical and short slant, the positions of the two short horizontal lines are basically level, and the starting point of the short vertical is slightly high.

During the process of epidural anesthesia, the anesthesiologist will inject analgesics (a mixture of anesthetic and sedative drugs) into the spine, which blocks the nerve pathway from the uterus to the brain, thereby achieving the effect of painless childbirth. However, this process may cause some side effects, such as numbness in the lower body. In addition, painless delivery may cause some complications, including low blood pressure, mild headache, nausea and vomiting, local anesthetic toxicity, total spinal anesthesia, allergic reactions, nerve damage or chronic back pain, etc., serious cases may threaten the life safety of the mother. These complications of painless childbirth are relatively rare in clinical practice, and do not have a significant impact on most mothers. Even if some complications occur, they are within a controllable range and the price is much smaller compared to the smooth progress of childbirth.\n"

        "query": "Why can't the body be cooled too much?\nExcessive cooling can cause various problems. Firstly, due to the stimulation of cold air, the autonomic function of the human body may become disordered, disrupting the normal rhythm of intestinal movement and causing an imbalance in gastric acid secretion. This can easily lead to heartburn, acid reflux, bloating, abdominal pain, and other gastrointestinal diseases. Secondly, cold air can cause the blood vessels of the gastrointestinal mucosa to contract, leading to ischemia and hypoxia of the gastrointestinal mucosa, reducing nutrient supply, weakening the defense barrier of the gastrointestinal mucosa, and causing gastrointestinal discomfort. In addition, in order to resist the cold, blood is redistributed, reducing the blood supply to the stomach and intestines and decreasing their function. Finally, for the elderly, especially those with multiple chronic diseases, cold weather can easily lead to colds, coughs, rhinitis, and other diseases. The probability of elderly people suffering from stroke, paralysis, and cerebral hemorrhage in winter is twice that in summer. Elderly people with a history of high blood pressure are likely to have sudden increases in blood pressure due to sudden drops in temperature, which can easily lead to stroke and cerebral thrombosis if not detected in time. For the elderly, a sudden drop in temperature can put a great burden on the heart, which can induce angina and, in severe cases, cause myocardial infarction, endangering life.\n"

        "query": "What bitter components do the ingredients themselves contain?\nThe bitter components in ingredients mainly come from various bitter lactucin, alkaloids, amino acids, and glycosides they contain. For example, bitter melon contains a chemical substance called momordicine, which is also found in many cucurbitaceous plants such as watermelon and pumpkin. It is not bitter itself, but it becomes bitter when combined with another chemical substance in bitter melon -- wild cucumber enzyme. In addition, the alkaloid quinine in bitter melon also presents a bitter taste, which makes the bitterness of bitter melon more prominent. In addition, bitter melon also contains a lot of bitter elements, bitter gourd glycosides and other bitter substances. In addition, the stems and leaves of lettuce contain lactucin, although the taste is slightly bitter, but contains vitamins, minerals and other nutrients, can absorb water in the intestine to promote gastrointestinal motility, speed up the discharge of body waste and toxins, improve food too fine resulting in constipation.\n"

For hyaluronic acid fillers, possible side effects include local reactions such as redness, swelling, bruising, pain or fever, which usually occur after injection and are temporary. Some people may be sensitive or allergic to hyaluronic acid, causing allergic reactions, such as skin itching, swelling, hives, etc. Nodules may form at the injection site, these nodules may require surgical intervention. Asymmetrical results may occur during the filling process, requiring additional corrections. Any injection process carries a risk of infection, although this situation is relatively rare. In rare cases, injection may lead to scar formation. In extreme cases, injection may cause vascular occlusion, leading to tissue necrosis. This is a serious but rare complication. Overall, hyaluronic acid fillers are considered safe and reliable. Hyaluronic acid itself rarely causes adverse reactions, the main problems occur during the injection process, there may be local fatigue, swelling, small hematomas, nodules, sensory allergies and other short-term problems. These usually recover in a very short time. There are also some more serious adverse reactions, such as hypersensitivity reactions, but this situation is very rare. In addition, over-injection may cause vascular compression, leading to local necrosis. There are also reports of foreign body reactions after injection, forming local small nodules, but these problems can be effectively dealt with through pathological examination.\n"

First, for electrical noise, you can try to ground the device shell through the wire, replace with well-shielded wire, or use an equalizer to cut off audio below 60Hz. For poor contact, usually caused by poor shielding of the audio line, you should use well-shielded twisted pair. In addition, you can try to keep the amplifier away, use software to reduce noise or eliminate sizzling sound in post-processing, or use high-end pickups. If it is line induction, you should use well-shielded shielding lines. If it is mobile phone interference, remember not to put the mobile phone near the recording equipment when recording. If it is monitor interference, keep the speaker and microphone away from the monitor. If it is monitor line frequency crosstalk, you can only temporarily turn off the monitor power during recording. If it is host interference, you can change power supply or motherboard and other hardware. Finally, if it is distortion, it is generally caused by too high recording amplification gain, the sound source microphone is too close, etc.\n"

        "query": "How does the resistance wire convert electrical energy into thermal energy\nWhen an electric current flows through a resistor, the current will do work and convert electrical energy into other forms of energy, which is the basic principle of resistance wire converting electrical energy into thermal energy. Specifically, this process is based on Joule's Law, which states that the heat generated by the current passing through the conductor is directly proportional to the square of the current, directly proportional to the resistance of the conductor, and directly proportional to the time of power supply. In other words, when the current is large, the heat generated is directly proportional to the square of the current, so a large amount of Joule heat will be generated in a very short time. In addition, electrical energy is converted into the internal energy of the resistance wire, causing the temperature of the resistance wire to rise. For pure resistive circuits, electrical energy is almost all converted into internal energy, and the heat generated by the resistance is equal to the work done by the current. In practical applications, such as electric heating plates, their working principle is based on the resistive heating effect. They include a resistance wire or resistance element. When the current passes, the resistance element will heat up and generate heat. This heat is transferred to the target object through conduction, convection or radiation, causing it to heat up.\n"

One reason is that pregnant women have increased basal metabolism during pregnancy, will emit more heat, so the basal body temperature will be higher than before pregnancy, and heat resistance is worse than before pregnancy. Another reason is that the fetus needs growth and development, pregnant women will intake more energy, coupled with the increase in pregnancy hormones, will cause pregnant women's fat and blood circulation to increase accordingly, resulting in an increase in their own basal body temperature, and the situation of sweating will become more. In addition, the body burden increases after pregnancy, and you will sweat a lot with a little movement, which is also a normal phenomenon. Pregnant women can do appropriate exercise to enhance their physique. However, if the pregnant woman's mood is not good, sleep is not good, sweats a lot, and the body is weak, these will affect the baby.

For example, if the dog's teeth are small, or there are no teeth, or there is some teething pain, you can try. For some picky dogs, you can also try, just love meat and don't eat dog food. For newborn puppies and old dogs without teeth, you can operate as follows. The difference is the amount of water added. For newborn puppies, in addition to drinking breast milk, you can grind the lamb dog food that the youngest puppies eat into powder, and then add more water to make it into a paste, and let the dog eat it by itself. In addition, you can refer to the experience of some pet owners, such as Romeo, who is 19 years old this year, all his teeth have fallen out, and he has heart disease and epilepsy, so they have appropriately adjusted his meals and feeding times. They have always spoiled him and have not followed scientific feeding methods like some dog owners. So their meals are for reference only. The only basis is that he loves to eat, and the color of the poop every day is also very normal. He has been eating Royal Canin dog food since he was a child. After he was 8 years old, he has been eating PR27. Now because he has no teeth, they will crush the dog food for him. But he will not eat pure dog food from childhood to adulthood. He used to eat it with stewed meat. The current recipe is: one of the four options of pumpkin, sweet potato, taro, and yam is steamed, a proper amount of meat mud canned food (the brand is not mentioned to avoid suspicion of advertising) and dog food crumbs are mixed together. Some capsule medicines will remove the capsule skin and sprinkle the medicine on the food. Because there are meat mud and steamed sweet potatoes, even if the dog food crumbs are very dry, they can be mixed together to make a sticky state, which is easy to mix with the medicine. He will not eat by himself from childhood to adulthood, they have to feed him one bite at a time. There is no way, they are used to it. Because he has heart disease and epilepsy. So in order to reduce the burden on the heart, give him less food and more meals. Feed four times a day, the bowl size is as shown in the picture (the bowl is made by themselves), two full bowl servings and two half bowl servings. The latest meal must be fed before eight and a half, otherwise it will be bad for digestion.\n"

First of all, Spathiphyllum hydroponics does not have high requirements for containers, but it is best to use transparent glass containers, so that the roots of Spathiphyllum can get better light and observe the growth situation. Secondly, Spathiphyllum hydroponics has higher requirements for water quality. If the water is not changed for a long time, it is easy to breed bacteria in the water and the nutrients are limited, which affects the growth of Spathiphyllum. Generally, the water is changed every five days. In addition, place the hydroponic Spathiphyllum in a bright diffused light indoors, avoid overly shaded maintenance environment, so as not to affect flowering. Spathiphyllum hydroponics is afraid of freezing, the winter maintenance temperature should not be lower than 10 degrees Celsius, and shading measures should be taken to cool down when it exceeds 35 degrees Celsius in summer. Keep the water level not over half of the root system, change the water in time when the water is turbid, and replenish the water in time when the water is insufficient. Each time you change the water, you can add 2-3 drops of nutrient solution to the water to provide nutrients. But fertilization should not be too much, so as not to cause Spathiphyllum root rot. Regularly prune dead leaves and excessively long root systems to promote plant growth. Pay attention to observe the growth of Spathiphyllum, and deal with pests and diseases in time to prevent spreading. During the maintenance process, pay attention to gradually adapt to different environments and avoid sudden changes in maintenance conditions.\n"

Firstly, when the mother uses oxytocin, she may experience a situation where the drip speed is too fast, causing too much absorption of the drug. This can cause the mother to have rigid and spasmodic uterine contractions. These contractions can adversely affect the birth of the fetus, easily thinning the lower part of the mother's uterus, causing heavy bleeding, affecting oxygen supply, and causing the fetus to be hypoxic. Secondly, after using oxytocin, the time of uterine contractions will increase, and the interval time will be shortened. Some mothers even have contractions without interval. This not only increases the woman's pain, but also adversely affects the blood circulation of the placenta. If you cannot give birth smoothly, it may cause the fetus to have acute intrauterine hypoxia, and even suffocate. This not only threatens the life of the fetus, but may also affect the child's intelligence in the future. In addition, when using oxytocin, if the fetal heart rate is too high, it may cause the baby to have an adverse reaction.

Secondly, the placement position of the dryer is very important, because the drying is mainly done by the tower-style air duct at the bottom of the machine body, which is exactly where the fan operates during drying. Therefore, when in use, the machine body must be placed on a stable table or countertop to work, and it is strictly forbidden to use it on carpets, sofas, quilts, clothes and other cloth items, because these cloth items will directly block the air inlet at the bottom, directly affecting the drying efficiency. In addition, the dryer should not be placed in a poorly ventilated place, because the gas discharged by the direct-row dryer contains moisture, this moisture will increase the humidity of the outside air, this moist air entering the dryer will affect the drying effect, easily prolonging the drying time or the drying is not thorough. Before or after each use of the dryer, clean the filter, you can clean the lint and other debris inside, otherwise, block the filter, affect the drying efficiency.
