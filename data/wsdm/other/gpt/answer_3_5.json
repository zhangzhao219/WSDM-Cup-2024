Use the along-the-wall measurement method: Start by confirming all hole names and marking the opening direction.\n\n2. Measure the hole size: Take measurements of the width and height of the door hole, ensuring consistency across the upper, middle, and lower parts. Take the narrowest part as the standard, with an error not exceeding 20mm.\n\n3. Check the wall thickness: Measure the thickness of the door hole wall at the upper, middle, and lower parts, as well as the left and right walls. Take the maximum value, with an error not exceeding 5mm.\n\n4. Correct any errors: If the measurements exceed the specified errors, consider correcting the wall hole using cement mortar or lime. If the wall thickness is less than 80mm, increase it to ensure sufficient support for the door frame.\n\n5. Consider special cases: If there are protruding beams or steps in the door hole, adjust the measurements accordingly. For T-walls, create a false wall with plywood matching the wall thickness.\n\n6. Account for wall tiles: In toilet and kitchen door holes, consider the thickness of wall tiles (usually 25mm for single-sided and 50mm for double-sided). Measure after the tiles are pasted and consult with the designer, customer, and renovation company for the final size.\n\n7. Note the opening direction: Determine the opening direction by standing outside and observing the hinge position. Left opening has the hinge on the left when viewed from the front, and right opening has the hinge on the right.\n\n8. Record and communicate measurements: Use a ruler or a mobile app to record the measurements and take photos of all holes on both sides. Provide the measurements to the door merchant, who can then consult with a professional master for further assessment.\n\nRemember, it's always a good idea to consult with professionals for accurate measurements and guidance throughout the process."

Prenasal sounds, such as \"an,\" \"en,\" \"in,\" and \"un,\" require the tongue to be in a forward position, with a slight curl and a slightly open mouth. The air is sent forward, and the mouth shape opens and closes quickly. Nasal sounds, such as \"ang,\" \"eng,\" \"ing,\" and \"ong,\" have a backward tongue position, with the tongue slightly raised and a wider mouth opening. The mouth closing speed is slower for nasal sounds. \n\nTo practice, you can start by pronouncing single words that contain these sounds, such as \"being,\" \"budding,\" \"economy,\" \"grand,\" \"peaceful,\" \"excited,\" \"confident,\" and \"uniform.\" Additionally, tongue twisters can be helpful for practicing these sounds in sentences. It is important to practice consistently and pay attention to the specific pronunciation actions, such as the position and movement of the tongue.

Firstly, it's important to maintain a clean and tidy home environment, as cockroaches are attracted to dirty and cluttered spaces. Get rid of unnecessary items and ensure proper hygiene practices. Secondly, it's crucial to use the right tools and techniques. Many people make the mistake of using insecticides alone, which may not be effective in eliminating cockroaches entirely. Instead, a combination of pyrethroid insecticides and cockroach gel baits can be used. The insecticides create an avoidance effect, making cockroaches less likely to approach the gel baits. Additionally, using Fipronil, a third-generation nicotinic insecticide, can help reduce the density of cockroaches quickly. It forms a touch-kill drug film that remains effective for several weeks. However, it's important to note that completely eradicating German roaches, a specific type of cockroach, may require multiple treatments due to the presence of unhatched eggs.

The fundamental aspect of pencil control is the movement of the hand, specifically the coordination between the wrist and fingers.\n\nTo practice pencil control effectively, here are some practical tips:\n\n1. Choose a medium-soft and slightly rebounding pen with thinner bristles for better control.\n2. Use black and white gel polish as a base and colored drawing gel for practice to make the lines clearer.\n3. Apply the colored gel and seal the layer to practice pencil control. Mistakes can be easily wiped clean without creating a mess.\n4. Cut nail polish remover cotton pads into small pieces for handling mistakes or correcting corners.\n5. Start with simple exercises and gradually progress to more challenging ones. Don't lose confidence if the lines are initially crooked.\n6. Ensure the brush is uniform and free of glue beads on the tip. Scrape off any excess before moving the brush.\n7. Move the brush using the power of the wrist, not just the fingers. Keep your hand stable.\n8. Utilize a dot bead pen for locating specific points.\n\nAdditionally, it is important to pay attention to the following aspects during pencil control training:\n\n- Use the center of the pen.\n- Focus on the fluidity and elasticity of lines.\n- Strive for symmetry in your drawings.\n- Aim for proficiency and complete use of pen techniques, ensuring clean and decisive strokes.\n\nCorrecting pen holding posture is also crucial in pencil control training. Common issues include incorrect thumb placement, hooked wrists, bent index fingers, arching fingers, and improper grip. Correcting these postures will help prevent problems such as heavy pen writing, fatigue, and slow writing.\n\nRemember, pencil control training is essential as a foundation for hand drawing, and practicing these techniques will improve your skills."

Secondly, pay attention to the use of water. Use water sparingly when painting gouache still life, and use a little more water when expressing light, thin, and transparent objects. Remember to wash and dry your brush between colors to avoid muddying the next color. Additionally, practice color mixing by laying out the main color on the palette and gradually adding other colors around it to create a rich color series. When coloring, start with the background, then move to the table and lining, and finally the main object. Remember to paint the fixed color first and adjust the inherent color to create a sense of depth. If you find any inaccuracies or areas that need adjustment, wait until the paint is completely dry before making corrections. Finally, focus on overall adjustment by gradually deepening the overall color and enhancing the darkest, brightest, and gray areas to achieve a coordinated effect. Remember to work in stages rather than finishing an object all at once."

To calculate your post-tax income, you need to consider deductions for five social insurance and one housing fund contributions, as well as personal tax.\n\nThe contribution ratio for the five social insurance and one housing fund is typically around 17.5%. This includes endowment insurance, medical insurance, unemployment insurance, and housing fund contributions. Maternity insurance and work injury insurance may not need to be paid in some cases.\n\nThe contribution base for these contributions can vary depending on factors such as base salary, performance, bonus, and commission. It's important to understand how your company calculates these contributions to ensure accurate deductions.\n\nPersonal tax is calculated based on your monthly income. Previously, taxes were deducted if monthly income exceeded 5000, but now it is based on cumulative income for the whole year, with taxes required if the cumulative income exceeds 60,000. However, you still need to pay tax every month, and if your annual income is less than 60,000, you can apply for a tax refund.\n\nTo calculate personal tax, you can use a personal income tax app or refer to the tax rate table provided by the tax bureau. The simplest calculation method is as follows:\n\nNet salary = pre-tax income - five social insurance and one housing fund contribution amount - personal tax\nFive social insurance and one housing fund contribution amount = contribution base * contribution ratio\nPersonal tax = (pre-tax income - 5000 - special deduction (five social insurance and one housing fund)) * tax rate\n\nIt's important to note that the specific tax rates and deductions may vary depending on your location and the tax regulations in your country. It's always a good idea to consult with a tax professional or refer to official tax resources for accurate calculations."

Electronic blood pressure monitors are recommended for home use as they provide accurate and convenient measurements. White coat hypertension refers to the temporary increase in blood pressure when measured at a healthcare facility. It is common in individuals who are easily anxious or frightened about their blood pressure. While it does not require special treatment, those with white coat hypertension have a higher risk of cardiovascular disease and should pay attention to their cardiovascular health.
